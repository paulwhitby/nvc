    'mg1': """Some of the most frequent zonations involving Arrhenatheretum stands are the often sharp juxtapositions of the various sub-communities and variants with one another or with other vegetation types along road margins. Such patterns are very varied and sometimes reflect long, local traditions of boundary construction and maintenance. Where stands are not maintained by cutting, zonations are generally a reflection of stages in succession to mixed deciduous woodland. This succession is most often mediated by grazing. Arrhenatherum is a ready invader of soils and calcareous talus exposed by landslip, construction work or the abandonment of ploughed land. It can also spread into and increase in certain other grassland types where grazing is absent or withdrawn or where there is injudicious pastoral treatment. Resumption of grazing can once more reduce its cover. Hope-Simpson (1940b) noted that, within four years of the removal of rabbits from a primitive Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis sward at War Down, Hampshire, Arrhenatherum previously no more than occasional, had become very abundant. Within seven years of the resumption of grazing by sheep and rabbits on an Arrhenatheretum at nearby Coulter’s Dean Wasteland, the vegetation had been converted to a Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis grassland with no Arrhenatherum (Hope-Simpson 1940b). Thomas (1960, 1963) showed that, after the virtual elimination of rabbits by myxomatosis, the coarser grasses characteristic of the Arrhenatheretum were among those species which spread in grasslands and heaths on chalk. These had previously been present in small amounts and had provided a valuable winter-green bite for the rabbits. They were reduced in cover when rabbit numbers rose again. Arrhenatherum can also spread into seeded verges and some of the floristic variation within the Festuca rubra sub-community (see above) is attributable to this advance. Increase of Arrhenatherum in Centaureo-Cynosuretum grasslands seems to follow careless grazing, perhaps by the use of such grasslands as horse-paddocks, and the Centaurea nigra sub-community of the Arrhenatheretum may originate partly in this way. Ploughing and subsequent abandonment of land after unsuccessful arable cultivation seems to have been a fairly widespread factor in the development of some of the more extensive stands of the community, especially on deeper soils over chalk. The Arrhenatheretum at Coulter’s Dean Wasteland had developed on land ploughed and abandoned some 30 years before (Tansley & Adamson 1925). Brenchley & Adam (1915) had reported a similar occurrence of the community on the abandoned and ungrazed Broadbalk Wilderness at Rothamsted. Several subsequent studies (Lloyd & Pigott 1967 in the Chilterns, Grubb et al. 1969 at Lullington Heath, Sussex and Wells et al. 1976 at Porton Down on the Hampshire/Wiltshire border) have confirmed the view that the Arrhenatheretum is one of the communities dominated by coarse grasses which can, in the absence of grazing, develop naturally on the chalk without the prior development of a Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis sward. The Arrhenathereta described in these studies are of the kind classified here as the Pastinaca and Centaurea nigra sub-communities but the lists provided are generally insufficiently precise to allocate stands unequivocally to one or the other. The available data suggest that the Pastinaca sub-community develops on the more calcareous and oligotrophic soils where these have been exposed by ploughing or where there has been a relaxation of grazing of calcicolous grassland. This sub-community is most common on the chalk of the south and east where P. sativa has its centre of distribution in Britain and where there has been a history of unsuccessful arable cultivation of marginal chalkland and pastoral neglect (see, for example, Smith 1980). The Centaurea sub-community is more widespread and seems to develop on more mesotrophic soils which are generally less calcareous. It is perhaps the more natural sub-community on deeper soils over chalk, such as those derived from superficial deposits, but it may also develop by the relaxation of grazing of mesotrophic grasslands throughout the lowlands, especially where this has been combined with application of fertilisers. Similar differences in the trophic state of soils may be an important factor in controlling whether it is Arrhenatheretum (of any kind) or grassland dominated by other coarse species such as Avenula pubescens, Festuca rubra, Bromus erectus and Brachypodium pinnatum which develops in any given situation. Wells et al. (1976) showed that, at Porton, the Arrhenatheretum occurred on land ploughed relatively recently where, they suggested, there was still a comparatively small accumulation of organic matter and mineral nutrients. Other coarse grassland types had developed on soils ploughed less recently which were consequently richer. If any kind of Arrhenatheretum remains ungrazed and uncut it eventually develops a pronounced tussock physiognomy and litter accumulation depresses species-richness. Shrubs invade and the frequently close hedgerows and field boundaries provide a seed source. Foremost among the invaders is Crataegus monogyna with Prunus spinosa, Sambucus nigra (especially where there has been disturbance and soil eutrophication), Rubus fruticosus agg., Rosa spp. and, on the more calcareous soils, Cornus sanguinea, Viburnum lantana and Ligustrum vulgare. Clematis vitabla may form a tangle among the developing scrub. Eventually, succession progresses to some form of mixed deciduous woodland but even very coarse and scrubby Arrhenatheretum can be converted to a low sward by grazing. At Aston Rowant NNR, Oxfordshire, four years of sheep-grazing in winter and spring drastically reduced the height of a scrubby Arrhenatheretum and converted A. elatius itself from large tussocks to small scattered shoots in a ground of Festuca ovina (Wells 1969: compare especially Figures 1 and 2).""",
    'mg2': """Spatial transitions between the Filipendulo-Arrhenatheretum and other vegetation types are partly controlled by the sharpness of local topographic discontinuities. Stands are often small and fragmentary and confined to ledges and embayments, giving way abruptly on less sheltered, sunnier slopes to the local form of calcicolous grassland. Where the vegetation is open to stock, grazing may blur the zonation. There is sometimes a gradation to mixed deciduous woodland of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis or Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mecurialis types. However, although many sites may formerly have had a more extensive local woodland cover, the broken terrain on which the community is typically found could never have been densely wooded (Pigott 1958). The Filipendulo-Arrhenatheretum should therefore be regarded as a persistent woodland margin community rather than a serai precursor. The occasional association of the community with old mixed hedgerows is interesting in this respect.""",
    'mg3': """Stands of the Anthoxanthum-Geranium community occur most frequently in fields bounded by walls or fences and each subject to a more or less uniform treatment regime. Spatial zonations between the sub-communities are therefore infrequent, although neglected corners and margins of fields with either the Briza or the Bromus sub-community may show a narrow transition to the Arrhenatherum sub-community. The blue-violet flowers of Geranium pratense often mark out this sub-community in summer. On verges which have a less systematic treatment such transitions are more common and irregular. The local appearance of mire species in stands of the Anthoxanthum-Geranium community may form part of a transition to flush vegetation where drainage of soil water is strongly impeded. The types of mire involved in such sequences depend on the calcium status and pH of the ground water and include the Pinguiculo-Caricetum and the Molinia-Crepis fen. Along stream sides where there is seasonal inundation a tall-herb Filipendulion mire may terminate the sequence. The striking floristic similarity between the Anthoxanthum-Geranium community and the field layer of open stands of the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis and Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodlands strongly suggests that this meadow vegetation has developed by canopy clearance and is maintained by annual mowing which excludes tall dominants (Pigott 1956a, Bradshaw 1962). Zonations between the community and such woodland are rare but occasionally the two vegetation types occur contiguously on identical sites separated only by a boundary wall. In Scandinavia, very similar meadow vegetation is mown in the clearings of such open woodland (Nordhagen 1928, Sjörs 1954; see ‘Affinities’ below). Traditional treatment has maintained the community in all its richness but the vegetation of the Bromus sub-community represents one stage in a process of increasing the productivity and decreasing the floristic diversity of hay-meadows in response to various combinations of fertiliser application, ploughing and re-seeding. This seems eventually to convert the vegetation to the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland or the Anthoxanthum sub-community of the Lolio-Cynosuretum.""",
    'mg4': """Stands of the community frequently show considerable variation in the abundance of particular species. Some of this is related to the distinctive bushy (e.g. S. officinalis and F. ulmaria) or tussock (e.g. larger grasses) habit of certain components but local variations in treatment, such as differences in mowing-time, continued over long periods, may also have an effect (Ratcliffe 1977). Zonations to other communities are most frequently related to differences in soil moisture status. Damp hollows in meadows sometimes show gradations to the Holcus lanatus-Deschampsia cespitosa community or to the Holco-Juncetum, especially the Juncus inflexus sub-community on more base-rich soils. These in turn may give way to Carex acutiformis swamp. Sharper zonations of this kind can sometimes be seen bordering the older drainage ditches which frequently traverse the meadows or in such places there may be an abrupt switch to the Agrostis stolonifera-Alopecurus geniculatus inundation grassland. Modern ditches around the meadows often have linear stands of Salix spp. or Alnus on their banks. Changes in treatment practice can alter the composition of the Alopecurus-Sanguisorba community and may initiate successions to other grassland types. An extension of grazing into the spring reduces the abundance of some of the most distinctive species of the community such as Sanguisorba officinalis, Silaum silaus and Fritillaria meleagris, all of which are highly palatable. This is the major community in Britain for F. meleagris and, if grazing is continued into its flowering period in late April to early May, it cannot set seed. At Marston Meadows in Staffordshire, a change from mowing to late spring grazing over the last 20 years has extensively reduced its cover (Ratcliffe 1977). It can, however, remain dormant in the soil for a number of years and seems able to recolonise fields from margins or ditch edges. If stands are ungrazed over the winter months, coarse grasses such as Arrhenatherum elatius (in drier places) and Deschampsia cespitosa (in wetter areas) may expand and eventually form stands of the Arrhenatheretum or the Holcus lanatus-Deschampsia cespitosa community. Drainage, ploughing, re-seeding or the addition of artificial fertilisers can all have a more drastic effect on the vegetation. Combined with an increase in grazing, such changes probably convert the community to the Lolium perenne-Alopecurus pratensis-Festuca pratensis flood-pasture or to the Lolio-Cynosuretum.""",
    'mg5': """Zonations in the Centaureo-Cynosuretum are usually related to edaphic patterns and, even in enclosed fields subject to a uniform treatment, there may be soil differences which reflect heterogeneities in the parent material. Within the Galium sub-community, an increase in Mesobromion species (such as Koeleria macrantha and Sanguisorba minor) is often related to a rise in calcium content and pH as the soil thins towards limestone exposures. Such patterns are commonly part of a complete transition from the Centaureo-Cynosuretum to calcicolous grassland on the Carboniferous Limestone of the Yorkshire Dales where meadows on till or head abut on to, or surround, rocky outcrops (cf. Ivimey-Cook & Proctor 1966b on comparable zonations in The Burren). In a similar fashion, there may be an increase of species typical of calcifugous grasslands and heaths in the Danthonia sub-community where its characteristic brown earths grade to rankers or podzolised soils over siliceous material. The patchy occurrence of Juncus spp. or F. ulmaria within stands of the Centaureo-Cynosuretum represents truncated zonations to the Holco-Juncetum or Filipendulion mires which are mediated by the soil moisture status. Such patterns are a common feature of meadows on undulating topography and frequently accentuate ridge-and-furrow with fragmentary strips of F. ulmaria or Juncus spp. on the less well-drained soils of the furrows. Alongside streams there may be a more complete gradation to poorfen vegetation. Occasionally, differences in treatment may be evident as zonations within enclosed meadows as, for example, where narrow belts of rich Centaureo-Cynosuretum remain on steeper banks within fields or around margins which have escaped improvement. Generally, however, differences in treatment style have a gradual successional effect upon the community which is evident in a range of intermediates between the Centaureo-Cynosuretum and more improved and productive grassland types. Two changes of practice are of particular importance. The first is an increase of grazing pressure. Growth starts quite early in the regions where the community occurs and stands may provide a valuable supplementary bite towards the end of April. If grazing is continued into the summer, and especially if it is heavy, there is an eventual decrease in the richness of the sward. Early-flowering species such as Orchis morio are then unable to set seed and there is a gradual expansion of rosette hemicryptophytes. The occurrence of the poisonous Colchicum autumnale in stands of the community has sometimes led to their being set aside for hay but some farmers have destroyed this species so as to allow an expansion of grazing. In fact, C. autumnale is more toxic during the early part of the season than in summer (Butcher 1954). Frequent mowing of the community, as occurs in some churchyards and on some verges and lawns, appears to have a similar effect to an increase in grazing. Although such treatment may permit the survival of an impoverished form of the Centaureo-Cynosuretum, the trend is for the sward to be converted eventually to the Lolio-Cynosuretum. This change may be further encouraged by the second, now very widespread, alteration in treatment. This is the replacement of the traditional farmyard manure by artificial mineral fertilisers. These enhance the growth of the grasses to the detriment of the dicotyledons. Lotus corniculatus and Leontodon hispidus are often the first species to be lost from the vegetation but a much greater impoverishment accompanies the rise in productivity in the long term. More drastic treatments of the community involve ploughing or the use of total weedkillers such as paraquat and re-seeding to produce Lolio-Cynosuretum or various kinds of ley. Such artificial successions to pasture depend ultimately on the maintenance of grazing. When the Centaureo-Cynosuretum or its derivatives are ungrazed, there is an expansion of coarser grasses and an eventual invasion of shrubs. The Lathyrus and Galium sub-communities seem to progress to various types of Arrhenatheretum or, on more calcareous soils, to one of the coarser Mesobromion swards. The exact nature of the succession may also be influenced by the fertiliser regime on the original meadow. Ungrazed stands of the Danthonia sub-community may be directly invaded by heath shrubs or Ulex europeaus. The results of careless grazing are sometimes evident as mosaics of Centaureo-Cynosuretum with patches of coarse grassland or heath. Distribution Stands of the community occur throughout the British lowlands but the centre of distribution is on the claylands of the Midlands. Even here, however, agricultural improvement has drastically reduced the extent of the community. The sub-communities are distributed largely in relation to local and regional variations in soil type. The Lathyrus sub-community is the most widespread type with the Galium sub-community showing a more restricted occurrence, largely over calcareous bedrocks. The Danthonia sub-community extends the altitudinal range of the community on to the upland margins of the Welsh borderlands and northern England. In the harsh montane climate of the northern Pennines the community is replaced by the Anthoxanthum-Geranium community. As with this other increasingly restricted meadow type, verge stands provide a valuable reserve.""",
    'mg6': """The application of careful uniform treatment within enclosed pasture stands of the Lolio-Cynosuretum tends to minimise the occurrence of zonations. However, where past improvement has been uneven, transitions may remain. Steeper banks inaccessible to ploughing may still carry patches of Centaureo-Cynosuretum as remnants of previous meadow vegetation. Hollows resistant to drainage may have the Holcus-Deschampsia community or Holco-Juncetum; the Deschampsia and Iris variants of the Typical sub-community can be seen as truncated zonations to such vegetation which occur where drainage is less successful. Where rivers and pools are not embanked, the Alopecurus geniculatus variant represents part of a transition to the vegetation of regularly-inundated water margins. Where pastures have been won from rocky upland topography, there may be zonations to calcifugous grasslands (with the Anthoxanthum sub-community) or calcicolous grasslands (with the Trisetum sub-community) as the soil thins to some type of lithomorphic profile around outcrops. The Lolio-Cynosuretum can be derived from a very wide range of vegetation types (Figure 9) including, in extreme cases, communities of stabilised sand-dunes and blanket mire. Certain kinds of agricultural treatment or neglect may allow some of the more closely related types of original unimproved vegetation to replace the Lolio-Cynosuretum. In older pastures, a return to more traditional organic manuring and the withdrawal of summer grazing may permit the re-establishment of the meadow vegetation of the Centaureo-Cynosuretum. This is perhaps more likely in the Anthoxanthum and Trisetum sub-communities where certain meadow species persist or where there are fragments of meadow-sward on banks or adjacent verges. Similarly, the choking of drains may permit the development of extensive Holco-Juncetum. Generally, however, successions involving the Lolio-Cynosuretum appear to be mediated by grazing. Undergrazing allows coarser species to increase their cover and this is sometimes a prelude to the invasion and spread of Arrhenatherum elatius and the development of an Arrhenatheretum. Abandoned pasture often shows a patchy mosaic of the two communities with scattered saplings of Crataegus monogyna. Where grazing is too severe, the sward may be opened up for invasion by weeds and rabbit infestation may speed the run-down to some weed-dominated vegetation. Trampling may be an attendant problem with over-grazing by cattle but is especially important in recreational and amenity stands of the Lolio-Cynosuretum where heavy use along footpaths, around gateways and in goal-mouths may produce a succession to Lolio-Plantaginion vegetation.""",
    'mg7': """None""",
    'mg8': """Enclosed stands of the community in riverside pastures may be subject to uniform treatment and show no zonations to other vegetation types. In some cases, however, improvement and management have been restricted by difficult topography and an inability to prevent flooding. Here, and around the more fragmentary spring and flush stands, there may be zonations related to soil moisture conditions. A usual pattern is for the Cynosurus-Caltha community to give way to inundation communities on the bare substrates of river banks or pool-sides or to small-sedge mires of the Caricion davallianae in base-rich flushes. On drier ground, there may be a transition to the Lolium-Alopecurus-Festuca flood-pasture or, where there has been extensive improvement, directly to Lolio-Cynosuretum. Such a sequence can be seen on the drained levels of West Sedgemoor in Somerset. Artificial drainage can mediate a successional sequence from the Cynosurus-Caltha community to drier pasture types but neglect permits a fairly rapid invasion of Salix spp. and other shrubs and trees of wet woodland.""",
    'mg9': """The community occurs very frequently as part of zonations related to differences in soil moisture status. The Poa sub-community is common in moist hollows within pastures and on grazed verges where there is gleying and it commonly gives way, with a decrease in the cover of D. cespitosa, to Lolio-Cynosuretum or the Lolium-Alopecurus-Festuca community on better-drained soils. Around permanently wet hollows, pools and lakes, the community regularly forms part of an ecotone to some type of fen or swamp or, where there is a frequent rise and fall of water level, as around reservoirs, to a sequence of inundation communities. In many cases, it is possible to discern a range of intermediates between the Holcus-Deschampsia community and its neighbours and, in zonations to fen-meadows, there is, or has been in the past, the further complication of mowing and grazing effects. Such transitional swards may also figure in serai changes that ensue in badly-managed or abandoned pastures and meadows. Once established, D. cespitosa cannot be totally eradicated by continued grazing and, if drainage deteriorates, it will slowly spread to dominate in the Poa sub-community. Even where drainage is improved, preferential grazing of other species may prevent D. cespitosa being ousted by possible competitors. Where there is a reduction of grazing on better-drained land, the Arrhenatherum sub-community may develop from pasture swards. Although a switch to mowing is probably the best form of control of D. cespitosa (Davy 1980), the silting up of ditches within meadows may precipitate a spread of the community. If grazing continues, the Holcus-Deschampsia grassland is maintained as a plagioclimax and, even when it ceases, the densely-tussocky character of the vegetation often severely hinders any establishment of seedling shrubs and trees. Where succession to woodland does occur, it is usually to the Deschampsia sub-communities of the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia or Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodlands. Stands of the Holcus-Deschampsia grassland can often be found in rides and clearings in tracts of these kinds of woodlands or planted replacements of them in forests on heavy, clay soils with considerable continuity among the herb flora. In such situations, the Holcus-Deschampsia grassland can provide an important seed source for the spread of D. cespitosa beneath the trees when felling or coppicing increases the light.""",
    'mg10': """The community very commonly occurs in mosaics related to patterns of soil moisture. The Typical sub-community is very frequent as patches and sometimes as extensive stands in damper hollows in the Lolio-Cynosuretum and Centaureo-Cynosuretum and distinctive patterns often reflect the occurrence of ridge-and-furrow or drains that are too widely spaced, rushy strips picking out the wetter bands of soil. The Juncus inflexus sub-community is encountered in less well-drained areas within more calcareous soils in the Alopecurus-Sanguisorba flood-meadow and the more calcicolous types of Centaureo-Cynosuretum. The Iris sub-community occurs in often very prominent patches in alluvial Lolio-Cynosuretum in western river valleys. Where the water-table rises beside streams and pools, the Holco-Juncetum may form part of a complete or partial transition from grassland to swamp, fen or inundation communities. Here, as with the field mosaics, there may be a range of intermediate types of vegetation based on the abundance of the dominant Junci. The Holco-Juncetum commonly develops by the invasion of J. effusus and J. inflexus into established or newly-seeded grasslands. A number of studies have demonstrated that J. effusus produces formidable quantities of seed (Chippindale & Milton 1934, Milton 1936, 1948, Moore & Burr 1948, Salisbury 1964) and that these are readily dispersed by wind, by animals and farm machinery after the seed-coat becomes mucilaginous, and by water (Richards & Clapham 1941b, Salisbury 1964). However, two conditions must be fulfilled for germination and survival of the seedlings: light and soil-surface humidity (Moore & Burr 1948, Lazenby 1955a, b, Agnew 1961). Successful invasion is therefore most readily achieved in a broken or badly-seeded sward where the soil surface does not dry out, conditions which are often met in over-grazed and poached pasture or on ill-drained land that is being put down to leys. Once established, the Holco-Juncetum is not readily eradicated. Grazing alone will not reduce the cover of J. effusus or J. inflexus and both are relatively tolerant of mowing. Systematic drainage, re-seeding and fertilising probably convert the community to the Lolium-Alopecurus-Festuca flood-pasture or Lolio-Cynosuretum but careful pastoral management is necessary to prevent re-infestation. Ungrazed stands may be invaded by shrubs and trees tolerant of wet soils and eventually be converted to scrub and woodland.""",
    'mg11': """Zonations involving the community most frequently reflect patterns of soil moisture and, on salt-marshes, the frequency of inundation of salt-laden water. Inland stands of the Lolium sub-community are frequently rather uniform but, where this vegetation occurs patchily in less well-managed grasslands, it grades, on drier ground, to some form of pasture, such as the Lolio-Cynosuretum or the Lolium-Alopecurus-Festuca community, and, around open water, to the Agrostis stolonifera-Alopecurus geniculatus grassland or to more open inundation communities. Salt-marsh stands of the Lolium sub-community and the Atriplex sub-community often pass down-marsh to some form of the Juncus maritimus community or Juncetum gerardi (such as the Leontodon sub-community or its derivatives). Secondary successions to the latter can sometimes be seen in turf-cuttings in the upper marsh which may be quickly colonised by P. anserina and have temporary stands of the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla community. Up-marsh, zonations are frequently terminated artificially by a sea-wall or bank but the community sometimes grades to a less frequently inundated form of pasture, free of halophytes. Similarly, the Honkenya sub-community may form a transition zone between more unstable and halophytic Strandline or shingle vegetation and essentially inland grassland. Festuca arundinacea is a sometimes conspicuous occasional in the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla community and probably increases its cover with a relaxation of grazing. Zonations between this community and the Potentillo-Festucetum arundinaceae may therefore be a reflection of successions between these two vegetation types mediated by changes in pasturing intensity.""",
    'mg12': """The Lolium-Holcus sub-community generally shows abrupt zonations to other vegetation types, sharpened by treatment where stands abut on to agricultural land or by sudden topographic differences where stands lie on steep banks alongside ditches. Occasionally, there are more gradual zonations to the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla community with increased grazing pressure or, on the upper salt-marsh, to the Oenanthe sub-community on more saline soils. Although this latter sub-community sometimes occurs as extensive pure stands, it is frequently encountered in a mosaic with some form of Juncus maritimus salt-marsh which replaces it on more frequently submerged ground.""",
    'mg13': """Small stands commonly form part of the often fragmentary sequences of communities which develop around fluctuating open waters in relation to frequency of inundation and the amount of disturbance by sediment movement and trampling.

On moister silts which are more frequently inundated, this in turn may pass to more ephemeral inundation vegetation or to the Glycerietum fluitantis or related assemblages in the Glycerio-Sparganion. In washlands, the community occurs in mosaics with the Glycerietum fluitantis, the Festuca rubra-Agrostis stolonifera-Potentilla anserina inundation grassland and, around dykes, the Phalaridetum arundinaceae and Glycerietum maximae. Where the community occurs around areas of freshwater seepage on the upper salt-marsh, it may pass to more halophytic vegetation types in which A. stolonifera remains prominent.""",
    'cg1':  """Stands of the Festuca-Carlina grassland generally occur as relatively small islands of open, rocky vegetation within more extensive tracts of closed swards or patchworks of grassland, heath and scrub. Much of this variation is explicable in terms of an edaphic transition in moving from the limestone exposures with their often fragmentary and highly calcareous soils to areas of deeper and moister soils which, in the absence of heavy grazing, become invaded by ericoids or other shrubs. In many places, and especially where exposures of bedrock are low and much fractured, the community may cover entire outcrops. In some sites, however, the cliffs are more substantial and here the Festuca-Carlina grassland may become fragmented in the crevices and on the ledges of the rock face and give way over the more massive exposures to fern-dominated stands of the Asplenium trichomanes-Fissidens cristatus community in narrow fissures. Some of the species of the Festuca-Carlina grassland, such as certain of the pauciennials and Draba aizoides, can survive in this more chasmo-phytic vegetation. Elsewhere, on more unstable areas of bare limestone, where there is clitter and shifting accumulations of wind-blown organic and mineral detritus, there can be a transition to the more ephemeral vegetation of the Thero-Airion. On grazed sites (which are the majority), the most common transition around stands of the community is to some form of the Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis grassland, frequently, on these warm, south-facing slopes, the Helianthemum nummularium-Filipendula vulgaris variant of the Typical sub-community. As the soil cover becomes more continuous and slightly deeper (though remaining calcareous and base-rich), the sward thickens up and there is a switch to a more obviously grass-dominated turf with an increase in Mesobromion dicotyledons and a reduction in the frequency of pauciennials. Often, such junctions are marked by a strong vicarism between either H. apenninum or H. canum and H. nummularium, patterns which have been strikingly depicted by Proctor (1958). In those sub-communities where Koeleria vallesiana occurs (the Carex humilis and Trinia glauca sub-communities), there may be a similar abrupt switch to K. macrantha; elsewhere, this latter species runs right through the grasslands to even the most strongly parched stands of the Festuca-Carlina community. Variations in the sub-surface configuration of the limestone or local accumulations of loess or head can complicate such transitions. Then, more calcifuge communities developed over the deeper and initially less calcareous or superficially leached and acidified soils, can occur in close contact with the Festuca-Carlina grassland. This kind of mosaic is very characteristic where the Festuca-Scilla sub-community occurs on the Gower cliffs in West Glamorgan (South Gower Coast Report 1981). In the more maritime sites, as in Gower and on Brean Down, there is the additional complexity imposed by gradients, running more or less normal to the coastline, of salt-spray deposition. Here, stands of the Festuca-Scilla and Carex humilis sub-communities may have occasional records for certain maritime species and give way towards the sea to the Festuca-Armeria grassland or directly to the crevice vegetation of the Crithmo-Spergularietum on sea-splashed rocks. Likewise, transitions to Thero-Airion and heath communities further up the cliffs may involve more maritime vegetation types like the Armeria-Cerastium therophyte community or the Calluna-Scilla heath. It is doubtful whether grazing is necessary to maintain the openness of the more extreme habitats of the community, where topographic and climatic conditions are probably sufficient to prevent the development of a closed sward, subsequent invasion of shrubs and the formation of a closed woody canopy. However, bird-sown seed of shrubs can germinate in rock crevices and, if grazing is relaxed on the slopes where the community occurs, stands can be encroached upon by scrub relatively quickly: thus, Proctor (1958) noted a marked change in some stands of the Scilla-Euphorbia sub-community on Anstey’s Cove in Devon in only three years following the demise of rabbits from myxomatosis. Ligustrum vulgare seems to be the most characteristic early invader, but Crataegus monogyna, Rubus fruticosus agg. and, at some sites, the Himalayan introduction Cotoneaster microphylla, have also been recorded. In the sunny gaps within this patchy cover, tussocks of Brachypodium sylvaticum can grow up together with prominent plants of Teucrium scorodonia, Geranium sanguineum and Centaurea scabiosa with, in the shade beneath the shrubs, sprawls of Hedera helix. In time, such vegetation probably develops into the kind of wind-cut spinose scrub characteristic of many ungrazed sea cliffs. In some cases, where such scrub is encroaching more slowly from areas of deeper soil, it may grade to the Festuca-Carlina grassland through an intermediate zone of rank Avenula pubescens grassland with its characteristic mixture of Mesobromion herbs, tall grasses and dicotyledons and seedling shrubs or, in more maritime situations, through the Festuca rubra-Daucus carota ssp. gummifer grassland (South Gower Coast Report 1981). Some of the chamaephytes and pauciennials of the Festuca-Carlina grassland seem to be able to persist for some time in more open areas but they are soon overwhelmed by the taller herbage.""",
    'cg2':  """Most of the zonations within stands of the Festuca-Avenula grassland or between the community and other vegetation types are related to topographic and soil variation or represent stages in successions mediated by treatment. Gradations between different sub-communities related to topographic modifications of climate are relatively uncommon. In some areas, the local physiography is such that even quite extensive stretches of the community are predominantly of one aspect, as along the scarps of the North and South Downs. Elsewhere, the effect of exposition is confused by variations in treatment or stands are so fragmented that they do not encompass the range of possible aspects within a single site. However, in some places, uniform treatment prevails over rounded hills, scarp tops, circular or hemispherical ancient monuments or along the slopes of sharply-twisting valleys, and here transitions may be seen. In wetter regions, as on a very few localities on the South Downs, the Pseudoscleropodium-Prunella variant of the Cirsium-Asperula sub-community gives way, on south-facing slopes, to the Typical variant; in drier areas, such as parts of the Chiltern scarp, the Typical variant occupies north-facing slopes, passing to the Filipendula-Helianthemum variant on southerly expositions. To the west, as on hills and hill forts on the Dorset Chalk, or in the steep and narrow valleys of south-west Wiltshire, the Succisa-Leucanthemum sub-community is very characteristic of south-west aspects, grading to the Cirsium-Asperula sub-community (often the Pseudoscleropodium-Prunella variant) on north-facing slopes. Further north, there are a very few sites in the regional overlap of the Cirsium-Asperula and Dicranum sub-communities where these two vegetation types pass one into the other with a change in aspect, e.g. parts of Dovedale in Derbyshire and on the Great Orme in Gwynedd. Very often, however, in all these cases, a number of discrete stands of the Festuca-Avenula grassland are needed to include this kind of variation. Some edaphic differences are probably involved in these topoclimatic patterns (e.g. Perring 1958, 1959), but the effect of soil variation on zonations is much more clearly seen where sequences of profiles have developed over limestones partly overlain by different amounts and various kinds of superficial deposits. Strictly speaking, these soil sequences should not be described as catenas, because of the hybrid origin of some of the profiles (e.g. Balme 1953, Pigott 1962, Grime 1963b, Bryan 1967): the sharpness of the edaphic transitions and the related vegetation patterns depend very much on the disposition of the superficials which is, in turn, related to topography. In general, however, the sequences are marked by an increase in the extent of the soil cover and its depth, and a decline in the influence of the underlying calcareous bedrock on the development and character of the soils. In such situations, the Festuca-Avenula grassland can occur in suites of vegetation types which may run from very open calcicolous chasmophyte communities on exposed bedrock right through to heath over brown earths. As with aspect-related zonations, many such sequences have now been disturbed or disrupted by agricultural activity leaving modified remnants in disjunct array, but two kinds ofintact sequences can still be seen. The first occurs where flatter limestone surfaces have an uneven cover of superficial which thins in places to shallow native rendzinas or rock exposures. Such patterns are best seen on the characteristic benches which develop on Carboniferous Limestone where the Festuca-Avenula grassland often forms a narrow zone towards their outer edges, giving way to heath further back and to some kind of open calcicolous vegetation over the rocky bench edge (rarely with pavement outside the limits of the Final Glaciation where the community is mostly found). On the western coastal exposures of the Carboniferous Limestone in the Mendips and Wales, where these rocky cliff tops are often very hot and dry, some very distinctive zonations of this kind occur with various types of Festuca-Carlina grassland grading to Festuca-Avenula grassland (often through the Filipendula-Helianthemum variant of the Cirsium-Asperula sub-community), then to Nardo-Galion grasslands and heath (e.g. Proctor 1956, 1958, Shimwell 1968a, Rodwell 1974, South Gower Coast Report 1981). Sometimes, a more discontinuous cover of drift is reflected in complex mosaics of Festuca-Avenula grassland and heath (e.g. Gittins 1965a). Such patterns are rarer on the Chalk where the dipslope plateaus have been more systematically exploited for agriculture but fragments were described from Porton Down on the Hampshire/Wiltshire border by Wells et al. (1976) where rendzinas carrying some Festuca-Avenula grassland were replaced locally by brown earths over Tertiary cappings with Nardo-Galion grasslands. At Lullington Heath in Sussex, Grubb et al. (1969) found some transitions from heath to Festuca-Avenula grassland where practice blast-bombing had blown away a cover of loess from the Chalk surface leaving a man-made rendziniform soil. (The much more complete sequences described by Watt (1940 et seq.) from the Breckland Chalk are considered under the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland.) The second and much more widespread situation occurs where soil sequences develop over the graded slopes of valley sides and the more rounded scarps of softer limestones. Here, slope rendzinas with Festuca-Avenula grassland pass, with varying degrees of abruptness at the brow-top, to drift-derived soils with Nardo-Galion grasslands and heath. The zonations described from the Derbyshire Dales (Balme 1953, Pigott 1962, Grime 1963b, Shimwell 1968a, b) are of this kind and here, on the harder Carboniferous Limestone, the sequence may run on to screes and cliffs with a fragmentation of the Festuca-Avenula sward and its replacement by open fern-dominated or Thero-Airion vegetation on crevice protorendzinas. This element is usually lacking on the softer Chalk, although open communities do occur in those few places, as on river cliffs and in the gaps along the North and South Downs (e.g. Lousley 1950, Rose 1973), where bedrock is exposed. The basic sequence is, however, widespread in the south, although it is often truncated or fragmented by cultivation right to the scarp top and the conversion of the bulk of the dip slopes to arable (e.g. Hodgson 1967, Jarvis 1973, Cope 1976, Ratcliffe 1977, Jarvis et al. 1979). The particular sub-communities and variants of the Festuca-Avenula grassland involved in these zonations vary (largely in relation to regional and local climate) but especial interest attaches to the fact that the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community often forms a transition zone between the more calcicolous kind of Festuca-Avenula swards on the shallow rendzinas and the Nardo-Galion grasslands on the deeper brown earths. The soils under this sub-community are often contaminated with superficials as, for example, around deep drift deposits on plateaus or where, towards the upper parts of slopes, there is some downwash (Pigott 1962, Grime 1963b) but, in general, they approximate to the calcareous brown earth type (‘mull rendzina’ in the older terminology). They are deeper, moister and somewhat more mesotrophic than rendzinas and, at least towards their surface, less calcareous and of lower pH. Not only does this combination of features promote a lusher and more mesophytic kind of Festuca-Avenula grassland but it also creates conditions which allow the invasion of certain calcifuges and the development of mixed vegetation which gives way to calcifugous swards and heath over the deeper drift (e.g. Pigott 1962, Grime 1963a, b, Grubb et al. 1969, Rodwell 1974). There is some evidence that certain of the calcifugous invaders can acidify the soils in their rhizospheres (Grubb et al. 1969, Pigott 1970a) and this may allow a progressive advance of the Nardo-Galion grassland into the Festuca-Avenula swards, though some species of the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community can persist to provide the calcicolous element in what has become known as ‘Chalk heath’ or ‘limestone heath’. Grazing also affects such changes because, if it is relaxed, such competitive power as the surviving calcicoles retain may be lost as the sward grows rank. Many areas showing the more subtle zonations between the Festuca-Avenula grassland and heaths, especially those on the Chalk, have been lost since the demise of rabbits in the myxomatosis epidemic (e.g. Grubb et al. 1969, Ratcliffe 1977). There is one further kind of zonation related to interactions between soil and climate and that is the type of pattern which develops where Festuca-Avenula grasslands come under the influence of salt-spray on coastal limestone exposures. Maritime influence is relatively low within the community itself, partly because some limestones, like the Chalk along the Channel coast, typically form very high cliffs whose tops are out of reach of spray. Even where stands are close to the sea, the influence of high calcium levels can overwhelm the impact of small amounts of salt-deposition such that there are just very occasional records for species such as Plantago maritima and Armeria maritima in what is essentially a typical Festuca-Avenula sward. In some places, however, the community grades to more maritime vegetation with increasing salt-spray influence, as on low Chalk cliffs and on the Carboniferous Limestone of the Gower coast. The usual pattern is for the community to give way down the cliff to the Sanguisorba sub-community of the Festuca-Daucus grassland or, on ledges and slumped chunks of cliff, to the Brassica community. Both these vegetation types preserve a calcicolous element though, with the decreased accessibility to grazing stock on such sites, these transitions are often marked by a striking increase in taller herbs and tussocks of Brachypodium pinnatum. Although some small measure of serai change in the Festuca-Avenula grassland may occur in response to pedogenesis (see above), it is variation in grazing pressure that, above all, controls successions to and from the community. Whenever grazing is increased or relaxed to any marked degree, or when there are substantial shifts in the proportions of the different grazing animals, physiognomic and floristic changes ensue. These are easy to describe in general terms, though there are relatively few detailed studies on the subject. It is the effects of grazing relaxation that are nowadays the more obvious. With the general decline in sheep pastoralism since the First World War (Shrub 1973, Smith 1980) and the catastrophic reduction in the rabbit population in the 1954/5 myxomatosis epidemic (Lockley 1964, Sheail 1971), extensive areas of Festuca-Avenula grassland have become rank and overgrown by scrubby woodland (e.g. Ratcliffe 1977). The early enclosure experiment on a stand of the community at Downley Bottom A (Tansley 1922, Tansley & Adamson 1925, Hope-Simpson 1941b) and later observations (e.g. Hope-Simpson 1940b, Thomas 1960, 1963, Wells 1967a, 1969, 1973) give some indication of the processes involved. The first general change is that the sward grows taller and more uneven. Although there is often a flush of profuse flowering among the dicotyledons in the season after grazing ceases, it is the grasses which, in the longer term, make the most pronounced vegetative response. They produce more and lusher foliage which can accumulate, after death, as a layer of resistant litter and some develop a pronounced tussock habit. The increased competition for nutrients, water and, especially perhaps, for light, then begins to induce a second kind of general alteration in the sward, this time in its floristic composition. Some of the characteristic dicotyledons of the Festuca-Avenula grassland are quickly overwhelmed, e.g. Hieracium pilosella, Asperula cynanchica, Polygala spp. and the therophytes and more delicate bryophytes of patches of bare ground. Others can maintain their position for some time in the ranker herbage by producing larger rosettes which depress or grow through the grasses (e.g. Cirsium acaule, Sanguisorba minor, Plantago lanceolatd) or adopting a bushier habit and sprawling over them (e.g. Thymus praecox, T. pulegioides, Hippocrepis comosa, Helianthemum nummularium, Lotus corniculatus). Even here, however, there may be some reduction in flowering and seed production. Surviving plants may become very attenuated and eventually die and they cannot easily be replaced because there is little well-illuminated ground where seedlings can become established. As a result of these changes, the sward begins to assume the composition and structure of a different vegetation type. Where there is no rapid invasion into the ungrazed sward of shrubs and trees, the nature of the derived vegetation depends partly on which grasses gain eventual ascendance and partly on which particular kind of Festuca-Avenula grassland is involved. The two are not unrelated because certain grasses are especially characteristic of different sub-communities or variants or appear particularly suited to invade one type of sward rather than another. Floristic variation in the original sward also determines which range of dicotyledonous associates is available to respond to the abandonment of grazing and the expansion of the grasses. Of those grasses which are frequent throughout the community, Avenula pratensis and Daetylis glomerata often become prominent in these circumstances and, in the more mesophytic vegetation of the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community, Holcus lanatus can increase (e.g. Norman 1957, Kydd 1964). Even the more diminutive species such as Festuca ovina, Briza media and Koeleria macrantha can remain very frequent and locally abundant in ungrazed swards. For the most part, however, it is the coarser and much more aggressive tussock grasses that now begin to make their mark and become overwhelming dominants. The most important of these, at least over the southern part of the range of the community, are Bromus erectus and Brachypodium pinnatum. Both are present in small amounts as low-frequency occasionals in the Festuca-Avenula grassland, though they are less common, especially the former, in the northern Dicranum sub-community. They can also invade recently ungrazed swards, provided there is a seed source nearby, although they may not be able to gain new entry into grasslands which have already grown rank. Once established, they respond strikingly to relaxation of grazing, expanding to overwhelm the neighbouring turf and converting the vegetation to communities in which each or both are dominant. The development of Bromus erectus grassland is reversible with a resumption of hard grazing and, even where this species continues to increase, the death and decay of the centres of its expanding clones may allow the reappearance of something resembling a Festuca-Avenula sward (Austin 1968a). Brachypodium pinnatum is different. It is much less palatable and, once established, it can be extremely difficult to reduce, let alone eradicate. Even at the time of the earliest surveys (Tansley & Adamson 1925, Hope-Simpson 1940b, 1941b), grasslands dominated by these species were very widespread on the southern Chalk and they have continued to increase in extent since then. It is possible that some of the floristic variation within them is inherited from the original swards which they invaded. Both Bromus and Brachypodium grasslands exhibit a contrast between more calcicolous and more mesophytic types which reflects the distinction between the Cirsium-Asperula and Holcus-Trifolium sub-communities of the Festuca-Avenula grassland. There is a third coarse and aggressive tussock grass which may be especially able to take advantage of the more mesotrophic conditions of which the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community is characteristic. This is Arrhenatherum elatius, an occasional in these swards and a ready invader. Lack of grazing is a key factor in its expansion and it can quickly assume dominance to form an Arrhenatheretum, perhaps, in this case, of the kind included in the Centaurea nigra sub-community. It is, however, very palatable and resumption of grazing can reduce it to virtual insignificance in the sward (e.g. Thomas 1960, 1963, Wells 1969). Two further species are of importance here. Avenula pubescens is frequent in some kinds of Festuca-Avenula grassland, again more conspicuously in the more mesophytic Holcus-Trifolium sub-community but also in the Succisa-Leucanthemum sub-community, the floristics and environmental relationships of which are more complex. It, too, can increase very markedly when grazing is relaxed and some stands of grassland in which it is dominant may have developed from ungrazed Festuca-Avenula swards. Festuca rubra is a more complex case. It is, in these data, much more uneven in its occurrence than F. ovina, though it is invariably F. rubra which is reported as becoming the more prominent of the two with lack of grazing. It is certainly very characteristic of some kinds of ungrazed calcicolous grassland, often in association with A. pubescens, though at some localities, like Swyncombe Down in Oxfordshire (Smith et al. 1971) and Porton Down on the Hampshire/Wiltshire border (Wells et al. 1976), as an uncompromising dominant. Finally, and much more local in its importance, there is Brachypodium sylvaticum. This is a generally uncommon grass in Festuca-Avenula swards, assuming but patchy prominence under grazing and especially associated with stands over harder limestones (like many in the Dicranum sub-community) where, incidentally, it is by no means always an indicator of former woodland. It can expand when grazing is relaxed and, being relatively unpalatable (e.g. Wells 1969), is less easily eradicated than, say, A. elatius, but it rarely forms a major component of closed, ungrazed swards over intact soils. The relationships between each of these species and the ungrazed environment, including its edaphic and climatic characteristics, are complex and little understood. Moreover, these grasses can often expand or invade together, producing a further element of complexity in the derived communities. Also, many of the stands in which they are now dominant, either alone or in various combinations, originate not from ungrazed Festuca-Avenula swards but from much more grossly disturbed situations, as, for example, where calcicolous x§grassland has been ploughed and abandoned. Some of the intricacies of these relationships are examined under the descriptions of the various communities in which these species are dominant. Shrubs and trees can invade ungrazed Festuca-Avenula grassland rapidly if there are nearby seed sources, and the expansion and closure of a woody canopy may then proceed alongside or overtake changes in the herbaceous component of the vegetation (as in the Downley enclosure which was adjacent to a woodland). The most widespread early invaders seem to be Crataegus monogyna, Prunus spinosa, Rubus fruticosus agg., Rosa spp. and Ligustrum vulgare with, thinning northwards, Rhamnus catharticus and Cornus sanguinea and, around disturbed and enriched sites, Sambucus nigra. These can thicken up quite quickly to form stands of various kinds of Crataegus-Hedera scrub, the edges of which often become clothed in tangles of Clematis vitalba. A number of orchids, notably Aceras anthropo-phorum, Himantoglossum hircinum and the very rare Orchis militaris, are particularly associated with the ranker ungrazed Festuca-Avenula swards found around the margins of such scrub. Two much more local invaders which can form distinctive kinds of scrub are Juniperus communis ssp. communis and Buxus sempervirens. The further development of these communities to mixed deciduous, Fagus and Taxus woodlands is considered in the volume on Woodlands and Scrub. The consequences of very heavy grazing of Festuca-Avenula grasslands are now much more rarely seen than in the days ofrabbit infestation between the World Wars and into the 1950s when their impact became especially obvious with the decline in numbers of sheep. Then, their vociferous nibbling and scraping, their dunging and urinating on the sward and their excavations in the softer strata and superficial deposits, produced striking and very widespread effects (see, for example, plates 2 and 3 in Tansley 1939 and figure 5 in Hope-Simpson 1940b). In some areas, their numbers have risen again as less virulent strains of myxomatosis have stabilised within the population. Their general effect on the Festuca-Avenula grassland seems to be to convert it to the kind of vegetation that is included in the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland, the community on which most of the classic studies of the effects of rabbits have been carried out (Farrow 1917, Watt 1940 et seq.). Here, there is a marked reduction in the numbers and cover of more palatable grasses, sedges and dicotyledons and a rise to prominence of certain bryophytes, notably Hypnum cupressiforme, Homalothecium lutescens and Pseudoscleropodium purum, in the more open sward. Also, with the greater disturbance, there is an increase in weedy species, not only those therophytes which are characteristic of open areas within the Festuca-Avenula grassland, but also grosser species such as Senecio jacobaea, Erigeron acer and Fragaria vesca. It was the local abundance of these, together with patches of, for example, Urtica dioica, Arctium spp., Verbascum thapsus, Hyoscyamus niger, Atropa belladonna and Solanum dulcamara, often attaining a grand stature on the rich burrow spoil, that gave the old rabbit warrens their distinctive, and often highly peculiar, appearance (e.g. Tansley & Adamson 1925, Thomas 1960, 1963). Variations in grazing intensity in the Festuca-Avenula grassland have a very considerable impact, not only on the vegetation itself, but also on its often very characteristic invertebrate populations (e.g. Duffey 1962a, b, Duffey et al. 1974, Morris 1967, 1968, 1969, 1971a, b, 1973). The complex relationships between the numerous and varied species and the plants are an essential part of the Festuca-Avenula grassland environment and make themselves felt through inter-dependencies such as those involved in pollination. Many of these effects are subtle and hidden. One often very obvious impact of the invertebrate fauna on the vegetation, however, is that produced by the mound-building activities of ants, especially Lasius flavus (Thomas 1962, Grubb et al. 1969, Wells et al. 1976, King 1977a, b, c). The hills produced by this species are large and roughly hemispherical and they introduce an element of structural complexity into stands of the Festuca-Avenula grassland, especially on the southern Chalk, which long outlasts their occupation; indeed, the ant-hills may even outlast the grassland, persisting after the abandonment of grazing and beyond the development of a woodland cover. The soil of the ant-hills is structurally finer and less dense than that of the surrounding intact profiles, though it does not seem to be significantly different in its chemical properties. It is also more free-draining and subject to greater fluctuations of temperature, the drying and heating being especially marked on the southern face. The mounds are also subject to various kinds of disturbance by rabbits, which use them as latrines, and various ant-eating or dust-bathing birds. Both sheep and rabbits may graze them preferentially, especially where the surrounding vegetation has grown rank. These effects combine to produce a complex floristic mosaic within Festuca-Avenula swards which is subject to its own distinctive successional changes. In King’s studies, the most characteristic species of the ant-hills were of two kinds: those within the immediately surrounding sward which were more readily able to grow through or on to the accumulating soil (notably the chamaephytes Thymus praecox, Helianthemum nummularium, Cerastium fontanum and, to a lesser extent, Asperula cynanchica) and therophytes, virtually absent from the intact grassland but able to find a very congenial germination ground on the mounds (Arenaria serpyllifolia, Veronica arvensis). With ageing, but continued occupation, the vegetation seemed to stabilise with large amounts of T. praecox and H. nummularium but, on abandonment, other species, especially Hieracium pilosella, became conspicuous to form vegetation which appears to resemble that of the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland. Although hills produced by moles (Talpa europaed) are frequent in Festuca-Avenula grassland and may be confused with ant-hills (see King 1977a), they present a somewhat different disruption of the surface and show a less peculiar flora. Mole-holes are rapidly excavated in a single operation and are quickly eroded by rain and trampling by stock to ground-level. Their soil is not structurally sorted, being simply a disturbed pile of material, and it may contain seeds and vegetative fragments which can readily regenerate (King 1977a). Though there may be a temporary flush of therophytes on the mound, the vegetation seems quickly to return to that of the surrounding grassland. The aesthetic appeal of Festuca-Avenula swards has long made them popular for recreation which can entail heavy trampling and sometimes the driving or parking of vehicles on the vegetation. Around picnic spots, there may also be particular kinds of cultural eutrophication. In recent years, a declining number of stands has come under increasing pressure from a growing and more mobile population and some sites, as on the North Downs (Streeter 1971, Dixon 1973) or along the north Wales coast (Rodwell 1974), have become especially vulnerable. The distinctive springy turf of the community seems resilient to a certain amount of trampling but, where this is concentrated, as along paths and around viewing-points, clear changes occur in the vegetation. In such places, there is often a local increase in resistant grasses, notably Cynosurus cristatus, but in some cases also Dactylis glomerata, Agrostis stolonifera and Holcus lanatus, and in some of the rosette species, such as Plantago lanceolata, Bellis perennis and Taraxacum officinale agg., at the expense of more sensitive plants like the chamaephytes. This gives such swards a somewhat similar composition to the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community and recreational trampling may play a part in the development of some stands of this kind of Festuca-Avenula grassland. Typically, however, the sward lacks the tussocky physiognomy of this vegetation, being extremely short. Also, the further appearance in the turf of Lolium perenne, especially where there is some eutrophication, often presages a rapid move towards Lolio-Plantaginion vegetation. Very similar changes to these were observed by Perring (1967) with an increase in horse-galloping pressure on stretches of Newmarket Heath, Suffolk, used for race-horse exercising. Most unusually among Festuca-Avenula species, the rarity Pulsatilla vulgaris is actually benefited by heavy trampling, which stimulates the formation of new rosettes from deep adventitious root-buds (Wells & Barling 1971). Even where this species is present, however, very heavy pressure may eventually disrupt the sward, allow soil erosion and expose the bedrock.""",
    'cg3':  """Zonations involving the Bromus grassland are most often reflections of seral changes related to the intensity of grazing and sometimes complicated histories of ploughing and abandonment. Occasionally, the community may show an abrupt transition to disturbed, oligotrophic soils that cannot, apparently, be invaded by B. erectus (Lloyd 1964, Lloyd & Pigott 1967). More usually, it occurs in irregular patchworks with surviving areas of Festuca-Avenula grassland, other rank swards that have developed with a demise of grazing (e.g. the Brachypodium pinnatum and Avenula pubescens grasslands) and scrub. Such patterns have been described in detail from Lullington Heath in Sussex (Grubb et al. 1969), Barton Hills in Bedfordshire (Wells & Morris 1970) and Porton Down (Wells et al. 1976) and they are a common feature of many areas of the southern Chalk and Oolite (e.g. Ratcliffe 1977). In principle, the fact that B. erectus will be eaten by stock and rabbits means that its expansion in swards is reversible with a resumption of grazing (Hope-Simpson 1940b). In practice, this may be more complicated. For example, Wells (1971) showed how B. erectus maintained its cover in this kind of vegetation over shallow, rendziniform soils with quite heavy grazing, even increasing in extent on deeper loamy soils. It is therefore possible that swards may stabilise with a higher B. erectus cover and that really hard grazing, with no alternative, more palatable herbage, is necessary to effect any marked reduction. The high cost of this kind of pastoral control has focused attention on mowing as an alternative means of retaining or recovering the species-richness and diversity of those calcicolous swards where B. erectus can gain a hold. Wells (1971) demonstrated that cutting in spring, shortly after growth commenced in March, was effective in holding steady or reducing the cover of B. erectus, perhaps by depleting the newly-mobilised food reserves. Regrowth was then poor and other species were able to capitalise on the provision of space. Summer cutting sometimes encouraged the expansion of B. erectus, perhaps because of stimulating the production of tillers when growth was in full swing. Though mowing is unselective (and not always practical on very steep slopes), it can be precisely timed and this may have advantages in allowing selected species to flower and set seed (e.g. Wells 1969, 1971, 1973). Burning, though it has been more traditionally practised on grasslands with Brachypodium pinnatum, has sometimes been used as a means of controlling B. erectus which, in dry weather, is readily ignited with its accumulations of litter. It may not always be successful. Indeed, it may stimulate fresh growth in the cleaned sward and, though new shoots may be more eagerly eaten by stock, without grazing the B. erectus may simply resume its dominance. The subsequent successional development of Bromus grassland with the continued absence of grazing has never been followed in detail. Though stands of the community often occur in close association with scrub, we do not know how readily shrubs and trees can invade the ranker swards. Certainly, some stands, after rapid establishment following myxomatosis, seem to have remained substantially unchanged for 30 years. Large populations of field voles (Microtus agrestis) often become established in such litter-choked tussocky grasslands and these may play an important role in eating and barking seedlings of woody species (Smith 1980). Deliberate or accidental burning may also repeatedly set back any invasion and help maintain the vegetation as a plagioclimax. Where colonisation by B. erectus is more gradual or patchy, it is possible that shrubs and trees may become established in the more open turf or on anthills which are often abandoned as they become increasingly shaded by the tall grasses (Wells et al. 1976, King 1977c).""",
    'cg4':  """The various kinds of Brachypodium grassland, like those dominated by Bromus erectus, commonly occur in zonations which reflect seral changes related to grazing intensity, forming patchworks with Festuca-Avenula grassland, other rank swards and scrub as on the Wye and Crundale Downs in Kent (Green 1973), at Castor Hanglands on the Huntingdon/Peterborough Oolite (Duffey et al. 1974) and over the Chalk of the Yorkshire Wolds (NCC Yorkshire Chalk Grassland Survey 1985). More locally, the community occurs with more open weed vegetation and scrub on quarry spoil (e.g. Shimwell 1968a). Because of its unpalatability, the expansion of B. pinnatum seems to be reversible only with difficulty. Grazing with sheep alone, especially just in winter, is ineffective and even all year round grazing involving cattle may do no more than simply restrict further spread and reduce the pronounced tussocky character of the sward (Hope-Simpson 1940b), Green 1973). Likewise, burning alone, though cheaper than grazing, destroys accumulated litter but may not reduce the cover of B. pinnatum: indeed, it can encourage further expansion, though twice-yearly burns in alternate years may prevent this (Green 1973). More effective seem to be combinations of these treatments, for example a burn in very early spring followed by very hard grazing, preferably by cattle first, then sheep (Hope-Simpson 1940b, Green 1973). Sprinkling salt on the tussocks may encourage stock to eat the herbage (Hope-Simpson 1940b). The assiduous care needed in such treatments to avoid deleterious side effects such as poaching of the soil, always a danger where cattle are grazing steeper slopes, or loss of invertebrate populations with burning, and the difficulties of integrating them with recreational use of the grasslands, makes mowing an attractive alternative. Mowing with removal of the cuttings has been shown to be effective in maintaining less tussocky and more varied Brachypodium swards and reduction in the height of the herbage may induce rabbits to graze (Green 1973). The further development of ungrazed Brachypodium grasslands has not been monitored in detail. As with Bromus erectus, the dense tussocky nature of some of the swards and the high population of voles which this encourages, may hinder scrub invasion. Though B. pinnatum is actually palatable to Microtus agrestis (Godfrey 1953, 1955, Chitty et al. 1968), it is doubtful whether voles make great inroads on the cover of the species.""",
    'cg5':  """As with other lowland calcicolous grasslands, stands of the community are now very much restricted to slopes or abandoned quarries isolated within landscapes devoted largely to arable farming. On such sites, zonations are usually a reflection of seral progressions related to the intensity of grazing and/or burning. Over scarp slopes, the community occurs in patchworks with Festuca-Avenula grassland (usually of restricted occurrence over the Oolite), other rank swards dominated by B. erectus or B. pinnatum alone, scrub and woodland. In old quarries, zonations may involve more open weed vegetation on young or recently-disturbed spoil and rock faces. The details of seral changes involving this vegetation type have never been studied. It seems likely that, in quarries, the Hieracium sub-community could progress to the Typical sub-community with colonisation of exposed surfaces and that either sub-community, perhaps especially the more open Hieracium vegetation, is prone to invasion by shrubs and trees. Continued burning and grazing can, however, maintain the community as a plagioclimax and some of the more extensive stands occur on commons where public demands and/or ownership by conservation agencies provide incentives to their continued maintenance as open spaces.""",
    'cg6':  """Despite the widespread decline in pasturing over the lowland limestones, large stands of the community are rare because the bulk of the most suitable soils has passed into arable cultivation. Where it does occur, this vegetation usually forms part of zonations which are both related to edaphic variation but also a reflection of serai changes mediated by grazing. The Dactylis-Briza sub-community is typically found as a narrow, patchy fringe towards the bottom of valley-side slopes or as small, isolated stands on local accumulations of colluvium or head. As the soil cover thins to more shallow, dry and oligotrophic rendzinas, it grades to more calcicolous swards. For the most part, these are various kinds of Festuca-Avenula grassland though, on the Durham Magnesian Limestone, this sub-community may pass to Sesleria-Scabiosa grassland. The more extensive stands of the Potentilla-Tragopogon sub-community at Porton occur in analogous edaphically-related zonations, grading to Festuca-Avenula swards over shallower rendzinas and on the sorted soils of occupied ant-hills. Over very oligotrophic, flint-strewn soils, especially where there has been a history of rabbit-warrening, the sub-community gives way to the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland. The most likely immediate seral precursors of the Avenula pubescens grassland are perhaps the more mesotrophic Festuca-Avenula swards, like those in the Holcus-Trifolium and Succisa-Leucanthemum sub-communities. In more calcicolous vegetation, ant-hills may provide nuclei from which the ranker grasses can spread. Once established, the Avenula pubescens grassland can probably progress to scrub provided the sward is not so overwhelmingly dominated by a mattress-like or tussocky cover of grasses as to leave no space for seedlings to gain a hold. The less rank vegetation of the Dactylis-Briza sub-community is more likely to be invaded and species like Crataegus monogyna and Prunus spinosa sometimes gain a vigorous hold in its deep, moist soils and from there slowly advance up valley sides. Rabbits may play some part in keeping the vegetation of the Potentilla-Tragopogon sub-community in check but, even without any grazing, it seems doubtful whether the very rank swards here can be easily invaded by shrubs. They may therefore maintain themselves for very long periods with, perhaps, some measure of cyclical change as tussocks decay and the weeds come and go. At Swyncombe, Smith et al. (1971) noted that, if Urtica dioica gained a hold on bare patches, it precipitated a very rapid breakdown of grass litter which opened the way for colonisation by more extensive areas of weed vegetation.""",
    'cg7':  """Zonations between the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland and other vegetation types generally reflect edaphic gradients or seral changes mediated by grazing. Most frequently, in soil-related sequences, the community represents the most oligotrophic extreme of a range of calcicolous communities, giving way, with varying degrees of abruptness, to more closed and mesophytic swards, over deeper, moister and richer soils. The Koeleria sub-community is the usual kind of Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland encountered in such zonations and, in moving away from the rocky knolls, cliff tops, fine talus or rock waste on which it typically occurs, it thickens up, generally to some type of Festuca-Avenula grassland or, where grazing has been relaxed, to ranker swards dominated by coarse calcicolous grasses. At Porton Down, the Cladonia sub-community occurs in comparable mosaics with the Festuca-Avenula grassland, picking out patches of the poorest and most chalky and flint-strewn soils (Wells et al. 1976). Such zonations can be gradual, the deepening of the soil being reflected in a hazy shift from chamaephytes, therophytes and bryophytes (and lichens in the Cladonia sub-community) to grasses and hemicryptophytes. However, where soil impoverishment has been produced by gross disturbance, such as ploughing, vegetation boundaries are characteristically sharp: stands of the Fragaria-Erigeron sub-community, for example, can pick out the shape of an arable field long after its abandonment, passing abruptly at its margins to the usually rank swards of adjacent neglected pastures (e.g. Cornish 1954, Lloyd 1964, Lloyd & Pigott 1967). Similarly stark patterns characterise the occurrence of Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland (usually the Koeleria sub-community) on the continually-disturbed soils of occupied ant-hills (King 1977a, b). More unusually, though much more famously, the community represents the most calcicolous extreme of a spectrum of oligotrophic communities, passing, over deeper and more acidic soils, to calcifugous grasslands and heaths. This is the kind of sequence first fully described by Watt (1936, 1940) from Breckland where both the Ditrichum-Diploschistes and Cladonia sub-communities occur as part of the range of his ‘grass-heaths’. The former type of Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland is very much confined to the most exposed and inhospitable, flinty rendzinas, being replaced over slightly deeper and less calcareous, though still base-rich, soils by the latter sub-community. This, in turn, gives way, over sandy brown earths, to Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland as calcicoles are eclipsed by calcifuges and the grass cover thickens up somewhat but, in the harsh continental climate and with (at the time of Watt’s survey) continued heavy rabbit-grazing and mole-disturbance, the general contribution made to the vegetation by therophytes, bryophytes and lichens remains important. As Watt stressed, the actual manifestations of this sequence, and its continuation into very calcifuge vegetation over podzols, are complex and often incomplete at a single site. Moreover, even the most intact of these zonations are now much altered because of the reduction in rabbit-grazing. However, it is clear that the various kinds of Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland respond rather differently to the cessation of grazing. In the more extreme types of sward, such as those of the Ditrichum-Diploschistes sub-community, edaphic and climatic conditions are so harsh as to prevent the speedy development of a more intact and mesotrophic vegetation upon enclosure (Watt 1962, 1981a, b). Some stands of the Koeleria sub-community, such as those over very rocky cliff tops, are probably similarly uncongenial to the spread of grasses and the appearance of hemicryptophytes. In other cases, as with the Fragaria-Erigeron sub-community, artificially enhanced oligotrophy seems to be so severe as to impede the formation of a more grassy sward (Lloyd 1964, Lloyd & Pigott 1967). With these vegetation types, the stabilisation of the soil surface and the accumulation of fertility is likely to be a very slow process (Watt 1981b). The Cladonia sub-community, on the other hand, shows much more pronounced and rapid changes with enclosure, so that the vegetation comes to resemble something akin to a Festuca-Avenula sward (Watt 1957, 1962). At Porton, too, Wells et al. (1976) suggested that this might be the fate of ungrazed stands of the Cladonia sub-community. But such resemblances are likely to be temporary, because the Festuca-Avenula grassland is also dependent on grazing for its maintenance and, among herbaceous species, it is perhaps the ranker grasses which are the likelier candidates as eventual dominants after long enclosure or abandonment. Here, too, though, there may be complexities: Bromus erectus, for example, in many ways eminently suited to these more oligotrophic, calcareous soils, seems strikingly slow to invade them, perhaps because of its poor dispersal (Watt 1957, 1962, Lloyd 1964, Lloyd & Pigott 1967). Avenula pratensis may likewise be inhibited from spreading for a number of reasons not directly related to the poor nutrient content of the soils (Wells et al. 1976). Other possible colonisers, such as Avenula pubescens and Festuca rubra, though they can gain an initial hold on abandoned ant-hills, may need a considerable accumulation of fertility before they can spread extensively (Wells et al. 1976, King 1977a, c). Even where changes in the herbaceous vegetation are fairly rapid and considerable, evidence suggests that, in some cases, they are likely to be overtaken by the invasion of those woody species which can establish themselves directly in the open and inhospitable conditions. At Lloyd’s Pulpit Hill Field site, for example, Cornus sanguinea was noticeably common among the Fragaria-Erigeron vegetation and he suggested that a number of features gave it an advantage over Crataegus monogyna, a very abundant early invader of Festuca-Avenula swards: high percentage viability and quick germination of the seed, indeterminate shoot growth and the ability to sucker and spread vegetatively once established (Lloyd 1964, Lloyd & Pigott 1967). C. sanguinea also occurred at Porton though, here, Juniperus communis ssp. communis was an important coloniser of swards of the Cladonia sub-community after myxomatosis, forming open scrub (Wells et al. 1976). In Breckland, Pinus sylvestris is the most prominent woody species, seeding in from the extensive plantations nearby, and even the Ditrichum-Diploschistes vegetation would seem to be progressing to open pinewood (Watt 1957, 1962, 1974, 1981a).""",
    'cg8':  """Since most remaining tracts of the community occur within enclosures sandwiched between plateau and vale agricultural land, natural zonations to other vegetation types developed in relation to soil sequences over the scarp are rare. In a few places, however, the Carlina-Hypericum sub-community can be seen grading through the Avenula sub-community to rank, mesotrophic swards over slope-foot colluvium. More often, however, the community occurs in mosaics with open vegetation, rough grasslands and scrub which reflect seral progressions mediated by soil development and the amount of grazing. Colonisation of artificial habitats, such as quarry floors, ledges and spoil begins with the appearance of rank weeds such as Epilobium angustifolium, Hypericum spp. and Erigeron acer and, in damper places, patches of acrocarpous mosses (Shimwell 1968a, 1971b) and proceeds to the more stable vegetation of the Hieracium sub-community. Where grazing is absent, this can probably be quickly invaded by shrubs and trees but, where stock or rabbits have access and there is deeper accumulation of soil, it is possible that it develops into the Carlina-Hypericum sub-community. With light grazing, the tussocky swards of the A venula sub-community may supervene and develop into patchy scrub with Avenula pubescens grassland or Arrhenatheretum between. The commonest scrub species in the area are Crataegus monogyna, Prunus spinosa, Ulex europaeus and Rosa spp. and the natural progression would be to the Geranium sub-community of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland, stands of which occur in close association with Sesleria-Scabiosa grassland. In damper situations, Salix spp. may appear as early woody colonisers.""",
    'cg9':  """Vegetation sequences involving the Sesleria-Galium grassland are generally related to edaphic transitions or, with some sub-communities, are a reflection of seral changes mediated by grazing. Two kinds of soil-related zonations are especially noteworthy. First, the community often forms part of a range of vegetation types which run from fragmentary communities over crevice protorendzinas on very rocky topographies to calcifugous grasslands and heaths over deeper, drift-contaminated brown earths. Such patterns are especially well seen on the characteristic benches which alternate with cliffs on the valley sides of the Craven dales (Rodwell 1974) but they occur widely in more fragmentary form wherever there is heterogeneity in the soil cover over the limestone. In some cases, as on the warm and dry edges of exposures around More-cambe Bay, it is the Helianthemum-Asperula sub-community of the Sesleria-Galium grassland itself which occurs as the most open vegetation type, giving way, further back from the cliff edges to the Typical sub-community as the soil cover deepens and becomes more extensive. Inland, where the climate is cooler and damper, the Typical sub-community usually gives way, over cliff crevices and on small ledges, to some kind of fern-dominated vegetation, either Asplenion communities or, especially on screes and in deeper crevices, to stands of Gymnocarpium robertianum. In other cases, transitions to screes are marked by a gradation to various mixtures of Arrhenatherum elatius, Geranium robertianum, Brachypodium sylvaticum and Mercurialis perennis. Over pavements, fragments of the Typical sub-community, or of the Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea sub-community where it occurs in solution hollows, may give way sharply to grike vegetation of which various species of the Sesleria-Galium grassland can make up an important component. On the deeper soils in such sequences, typically found some way back from cliff edges or over infilled, concealed grikes, there is almost always some loess or boulder clay. Here, the Typical sub-community gives way, with a sharpness that is often a direct reflection of the distance to the underlying limestone or the extent of contamination of the soils with superficials, to some kind of Nardo-Galion sward, sometimes with an interposed band of the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland in which there is a gradual shift from calcicoles to calcifuges as the dominant element in the vegetation. In the drier parts of the range of the community, as over the Morecambe Bay limestones, the sequence may continue to Calluna-Erica heath over acid but still fairly dry and light-textured soils. Where there is a complex patchwork of different soils over often very uneven bedrock surfaces, these different vegetation types may occur in close proximity, forming the intimate mixtures sometimes described as ‘limestone heaths (e.g. Moss 1911, Dixon 1982). Inland and at higher altitudes, this latter part of such sequences shows a shift towards vegetation types characteristic of moister soils. The Typical sub-community may be replaced here by the Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea sub-community which may pass to Nardus-Galium or Juncus-Festuca grasslands and then to Erico-Sphagnion ombrogenous mire. In the peculiarly extreme conditions in Upper Teesdale, such zonations tend to be telescoped so that the Carex-Kobresia sub-community is restricted to ‘windows’ within an expanse of wet heath and bog (Bradshaw & Jones 1976). The second kind of edaphically-related zonation is less common, though very distinctive. It occurs wherever there is some soligenous flushing of these grasslands, as when water percolating through the limestone hits some interbedded and less permeable stratum. In such situations, the Typical sub-community of the surrounding slopes gives way, sometimes through a zone of the Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea sub-community, to a Caricion davallianae mire, usually of small extent. At lower altitudes, this latter vegetation is usually the Briza-Primula sub-community of the Pinguiculo-Caricetum but, in Upper Teesdale, the Carex-Juncus sub-community can figure in these sequences or, on gravelly areas near to the flush heads, the Gymnostomum sub-community. The subtle patterns which these vegetation types form, and their susceptibility to disturbance, makes them a very precious component of the upland limestone landscape. Other, less frequent, zonations involve transitions to mesotrophic grassland over deeper, moister but still moderately calcareous soils. The typical situation for such floristic shifts is towards the bottom of scree slopes where there is an accumulation of colluvium, but these are frequently obscured by the enclosure and agricultural improvement of the swards. On rare occasions, however, there may be gradations to unimproved meadow communities like the Centaureo-Cynosuretum or, in dale heads at higher altitudes, the Anthoxanthum-Geranium grassland. In a very few localities, the Sesleria-Galium grassland passes to the Filipendulo-Arrhenatheretum on north-facing slopes where, towards the foot of cliffs, there is an absence of grazing. Although scattered wind-cut trees, such as Taxus baccata, Fraxinus excelsior and, in some sites, the endemic Sorbus lancastriensis, are a distinctive feature of crevices in the cliffs over which the Helianthemum-Asperula sub-community occurs (Proctor 1958, Clapham & Nicholson 1975), this kind of Sesleria-Galium grassland and the two montane sub-communities can be seen as climatic climax vegetation types from which the withdrawal of grazing would probably have little effect. With the Typical and Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea sub-communities, on the other hand, the soils are neither too dry nor too wet, and the climate insufficiently cold, to prevent the invasion of woody species. Stands which are inaccessible to stock show a marked increase in the grass cover, especially of S. albicans which can form virtually pure clumps but, though this species and many of the associates can persist for some time under a light woody canopy, these sub-communities are eventually replaced by scrub when grazing is withdrawn. Succession has never been followed in detail but the most likely invaders would seem to be Crataegus monogyna, Prunus spinosa, Corylus avellana, Sorbus aucuparia, Fraxinus excelsior and Taxus baccata with, on drier sites, Betula pendula and, over more mesotrophic soils, Acer pseudoplatanus and Ulmus glabra. Mixtures of these species commonly occur as dense thickets on scree slopes which are ungrazed and they can expand out from grikes on inaccessible stretches of pavement. On drier and warmer slopes, the succession can be to Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland but Acer campestre itself, and two common invaders of grasslands on Carboniferous Limestone further south, Cornus sanguinea and Rhamnus catharticus, are very much towards their northern limit in this area and are only sparsely seen in developing or mature woodlands. On moister and cooler slopes, the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland, the climax community on base-rich soils in the north and west of Britain, may be a more likely development.""",
    'cg10': """The community is very frequently found in zonations of vegetation types related to geological and edaphic variation and, at some localities, forms part of altitudinal sequences influenced primarily by climate. Sometimes, such patterns are complicated by seral changes mediated by grazing. The most widespread kind of edaphically-influenced zonation is found where the typically small exposures of calcareous rocks which carry this community give way to less calcareous rocks which generally make up the bulk of the surrounding landscape (Figure 23). At such junctions, there is a switch to less base-rich brown earths or, in regions of higher rainfall, to various kinds of podzol, and this is marked by transitions from the Trifolium-Luzula or Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea sub-communities to less calcicolous vegetation such as the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland or various kinds of upland heath. Ordered sequences of such communities have been systematically related to variables such as calcium content and pH of the soil in the Southern Uplands (e.g. Heddle & Ogg 1936, Nicholson & Robertson 1958, King 1962) and patchworks of these vegetation types are a very common feature of many upland areas, such as north Wales (Ratcliffe 1959a, Edgell 1969), the Lake District, the northern Pennines (Eddy et al. 1969) and on the Dalradian rocks of the east-central Highlands (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Ratcliffe 1977). Very often, such patterns are complicated by an overlay of drift which masks the immediate influence of the underlying bedrock and increases drainage impedence. Then grasslands dominated by such species as Nardus stricta, Juncus squarrosus or Deschampsia cespitosa and wet heaths or ombrogenous mires may be added to the mosaics. The resulting close juxtaposition of these different vegetation types over complex mountain topographies is well illustrated in the vegetation maps of the Carneddau (Ratcliffe 1959a) and Cader Idris (Edgell 1969) in north Wales and a more straightforward pattern has been described from the dip slopes of Carboniferous sandstones with intruded Whin Sill along Hadrian’s Wall by Lock & Rodwell (1981). Where there is flushing with base-rich waters within stands of the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, a different kind of sequence occurs. Then, the Trifolium-Luzula sub-community gives way to either the Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea or, with more continuous or pronounced irrigation, the Saxifraga-Ditrichum, sub-community. This, in turn, may be a transition to solige-nous mire, the Pinguiculo-Caricetum dioicae, or, particularly in the Scottish Highlands, the Carici-Saxifra-getum aizoidis. Sometimes, both these vegetation types are involved in complex patterns around strongly-flushed sites within stands of Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland (e.g. McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). Where dripping rock outcrops intrude into the vegetation, the Saxifraga-Ditrichum sub-community may pass sharply to Cratoneurion spring vegetation or to Saxifraga-Alchemilla banks: such patterns have been well described from cliffs within Dalradian schists and epidior-ites (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Huntley 1979), from banks on Hoy (Prentice & Prentice 1975) and around springs on the Jurassic and Durness limestones of Skye (Birks 1973) and they occur more fragmentarily in the Lake District and Upper Teesdale (e.g. Eddy et al. 1969, Jones 1973).""",
    'cg11': """Most often, zonations between the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath and other vegetation types reflect edaphic or altitudinal/climatic gradients or differences in grazing intensity. At some sites, the community gives way, over fragmentary lithomorphic soils developed over the same substrate, to more open vegetation, as on Skye, where it passes to scree communities on Tertiary basalt talus or pavement vegetation on Durness Limestone (Birks 1973). More usually, however, it occurs, often with the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, within patchworks of other communities whose distribution reflects the occurrence of different bedrock types and the extent of overlying drift. Where calcareous deposits are well represented, stands can be more extensive, as on Ben Lawers, in Caenlochan and Beinn a’Ghlo (Ratcliffe 1977, Huntley 1979); elsewhere, typical but smaller stands occur as islands within predominantly calcifuge grasslands and heaths over acid rocks or deep drift, as on the gneisses of the north-western Highlands (Ratcliffe 1977). Where suitable rocks extend over a considerable range of altitude, as on the Dalradian schists, the community may be part of altitudinal sequences which reflect the increasing cold and rainfall at higher altitudes. Then, it may give way below to the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland and above to the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene dwarf-herb community. The occurrence of crags within stands of the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath is a common feature and, at higher altitudes, the community forms mosaics here with the Dry as-Silene vegetation which reflect the lack of grazing on the more inaccessible ledges. Good examples of this kind of pattern have been described from Beinn a’Ghlo on Dalradian limestone and from Lewisian gneiss in Ross and Sutherland (Ratcliffe 1977) and the occasional prominence of taller herbs is encountered wherever grazing is restricted.""",
    'cg12': """The community occurs as part of vegetation mosaics which are related primarily to geological and edaphic variation and in altitudinal sequences which reflect climatic differences. Variation in grazing intensity is also important in influencing some zonations. Where the exposures of calcareous rocks are more restricted, as among the gneisses of the north-west Highlands and the Moine metasediments, the community occurs, sometimes as very small and fragmentary stands, in patchworks of calcicolous vegetation which provide a spectacular local enrichment on and around crags which intrude into more calcifugous communities over acidic rocks and drift. This kind of pattern is very characteristic of parts of Ben Nevis, Ben Alder and Beinn Dearg (Ratcliffe 1977). Where exposures are more extensive, notably on the Dalradian mica-schists around Breadalbane, stands are larger, sometimes of several hectares, and form a major part of considerable expanses of calcicolous vegetation in which the influence of variables such as the extent of snow-lie and the amount of flushing can be more clearly seen. In such sites this community may give way, in more sheltered positions and on cooler, north-facing slopes, to the more chionophilous vegetation of the Alchemilla alpina-Sibbaldia procumbens community. In other cases, and perhaps on sites where there is only a moderate influence of snow-lie but where the moist soils are somewhat less base-rich, there may be transitions to more species-rich types of Deschampsia-Galium grassland and, towards lower altitudes, Nardus-Galium or Juncus-Festuca grasslands. Where soligenous flushing becomes more pronounced at higher altitudes, the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene community can give way to montane Caricion davallianae mires such as the Caricetum saxatilis or the Carici-Saxifragetum and, where dripping rock faces protrude, there may be more abrupt transitions to Saxifraga-Alchemilla banks. Complex mosaics of all these vegetation types, together with soligenous mires characteristic of flushing with less base-rich waters, are a prominent feature of Ben Lawers. Here, too, where calcareous rocks extend over considerable altitudes, there are some good sequences from the community to sub-montane vegetation types, down through the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath to the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland or, where decreasing altitude is accompanied by some lessening of flushing with base-rich waters or increasing contamination with drift, to Nardus-Galium and Juncus-Festuca grasslands. A further, common zonation, probably mediated primarily by the intensity of grazing, occurs where the community gives way, over the inaccessible ledges and crevices of cliffs, to stands of the Dryas-Silene community and in the often fragmented transitions between the two, vegetation with intermediate floristics is often found.""",
    'cg13': """Most often, zonations involving the Dryas-Carex heath are related to edaphic variation which is dependent upon the topography and geology. The exposures of calcareous bedrocks in the north-west of Scotland, of which the Hieracium-Ctenidium sub-community is especially characteristic, are usually of limited extent and surrounded by more acid rocks. Stands of this vegetation are thus often small and they make up part of the patchworks of calcicolous communities that provide such a startling intrusion of fresh green into the dull brown cover that characterises much of this area. The outcrops are also frequently broken into cliffs, and dissected by crevices and grikes. Typically, therefore, this sub-community occurs in complex mosaics with fern-domination in crevice protorendzinas and woodland fragments in sheltered clefts and ravines. Such patterns are very well seen in the Suardal area of Skye (Birks 1973) and, to a more limited extent, around Durness (Ratcliffe 1977). At higher altitudes, on the hills above Inchnadamph, comparable mosaics involve montane chasmophytic vegetation, tall-herb communities and willow scrub (Poore & McVean 1957, McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Ratcliffe 1977). Very often, too, the exposures, especially on flatter land at lower altitudes, are smeared with varying amounts of drift which introduces a further element of complexity. Then the Dryas-Carex heath may pass to more calcifugous heath, perhaps through an intermediate zone in which Calluna vulgaris and Nardo-Galion grasses show an increase in cover. Flushing can complicate the pattern still further. Where this is intermittent, the community may persist with scattered Caricion davallianae species in the sward but, where it is more pronounced, there are transitions to sub-montane soligenous mires. Where base-poor waters flow through drift-contaminated soils adjacent to Dryas-Carex heath, the community may show a sharp transition to some kind of calcifuge mire. Comparable patterns to these can be seen within and around areas of shell-sand along the north Scottish coast, where the Salix-Empetrum sub-community is more common, though here the zonations can have more diffuse boundaries because of the continuously variable thicknesses of sand that are laid down. The open chasmophytic communities of bare rock are also replaced by vegetation typical of raw sand and, with increasing proximity to the sea, there is the additional feature of maritime influence. Thus, around Invernarver, Dryas-Carex heath occurs behind dune communities and among maritime heath, notably the Empetrum sub-community of the Calluna-Scilla heath. Disturbed areas within stands of the community may carry small patches of the Armeria-Cerastium maritime therophyte community. Further away from the sea, where the influence of deposited sand peters out, there can be gradations to various kinds of inland heath over acidic mineral soils and peat. As before, varying degrees of flushing with waters of differing base-status result in the scattered occurrence of small-sedge mires of various kinds (Ratcliffe 1977). Both sub-communities are also frequently found in close association with small patches of sub-montane swards, such as the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland or, along the north Scottish coast, the Festuca-Plantago maritime grassland. At somewhat higher altitudes, as along the slopes of the Trotternish ridge in Skye or above Inchnadamph, it may grade to the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath (Birks 1973, Ratcliffe 1977). The presumption is that such zonations are mediated primarily by grazing which, when very prolonged or heavy, is supposed to wipe out the D. octopetala (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). However, the survival of the community under grazing on Skye (Birks 1973, see above), like the persistence of D. octopetala in Sesleria-Galium grassland on the Pennines, suggests that this relationship may be quite complex (Elkington 1971). Enclosure experiments at Inchnadamph may help reveal some of the answers to this problem (Ratcliffe 1977).""",
    'cg14': """Most often, zonations between the community and other vegetation types are a direct reflection of the extent of grazing, though edaphic transitions related to bedrock and soil type are also found. Very commonly, the Dryas-Silene community passes, where ledges become more accessible, to grazed calcicolous vegetation over the more intact soils of the surrounding smoother topography. The communities involved in such transitions vary with altitude. Around higher crags, there is typically a zonation to the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene community in which the representation of those Arctic-Alpines tolerant of grazing is maintained. Such mosaics are well seen towards the upper slopes of Ben Lawers, on Beinn Dearg and Ben Alder (Ratcliffe 1977) and, on Helvellyn, the very small fragments of the community survive among more extensive areas of dwarf-herb vegetation (Ratcliffe 1960, 1977). Towards lower altitudes, the community gives way to the more sub-montane vegetation of the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath and the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland as on the lower slopes of Ben Lawers, on Beinn Laoigh, in the Caenlochan–Clova area and on Meall Ghaordie and Beinn Iadain. It is very likely that each of these three communities has, in part, been derived by grazing from the Dryas-Silene vegetation which has been progressively restricted to the more inaccessible crags but it should be remembered that, around the margins of these exposures, there is frequently a coincidental edaphic shift to more intact and sometimes deeper soils, even though the underlying bedrock remains calcareous. It may be presumed that the frequent instability of the crag environment with its exposure to erosion by frost and wind, and the often precarious hold of the vegetation on ledges, help maintain the characteristic patchwork of plants of differing stature. For the most part, stands are at altitudes which are too high for colonisation by trees and much of this vegetation represents a climax dependent on the extreme climatic and edaphic conditions. Sometimes, however, the willows form a more intact cover, shading out many of the species of the community, and transitions to such low scrub can be seen on Meall na Samhna, Carn Gorm and Beinn Dearg (Ratcliffe 1977). Grazing-related zonations such as these can be complicated where there are edaphic variations attributable to differences in the underlying bedrock and/or the character of percolating waters. Then, other less calcicolous vegetation types may occur in close association with the Dryas-Silene community. For example, where isolated calcareous crags intrude into areas of acid bedrocks, a common feature among the Moine and Lewisian Assemblages, Nardus-Galium, Juncus-Festuca or Deschampsia-Galium grasslands may surround stands of the community. In other cases, complexes of ledges run across geological boundaries or receive irrigation with waters of varying calcium carbonate content. Where flushing with less calcareous waters occurs, the Dryas-Silene vegetation can pass into other kinds of ungrazed tall-herb communities in which calcicoles are much more poorly represented. Such transitions are a prominent feature of parts of Ben Lawers, Beinn Laoigh, the Caenlochan–Clova area, Meall Ghaordie and Beinn Dearg (Ratcliffe 1977).""",
    'u1':   """The Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland usually survives now as fragments among mosaics of sub-shrub vegetation, bracken, scrub and woodland on lowland heaths where, after often long and complex treatment histories, response to neglect is generally the major factor in determining the pattern of communities. In other places, reclamation of such landscapes has been so complete as to leave small stands of the grassland isolated on more intractable or temporarily disturbed ground among intensive pasture, arable or forestry plantations, with some kinds of urban wasteland providing new habitats in a totally artificial context. All the more valuable, then, are those places where the community persists as a fairly extensive element of open, semi-natural scenery, as in parts of Breckland where there is the added interest of wide variation in soil conditions. Even in this most continental environment, the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland is largely a plagioclimax community ultimately dependent on grazing for its survival. In this light, the community can be regarded as the usual product of clearance and long-continued pasturing over parched, acid soils through the drier lowlands of Britain, where it has been closely associated with heath vegetation, grazing and burning maintaining the characteristic patchwork of communities. The particular kinds of heath with which the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland is still found are, however, quite diverse, its own distribution spanning the ranges of a variety of distinct sub-shrub communities. Through its heartland, in East Anglia, it characteristically occurs with the Calluna-Festuca heath in the extensive grass-heath mosaics of Breckland and the Suffolk Sandlings and among the drier vegetation of the Norfolk Commons; here the Typical, Erodium-Teesdalia and Cornicularia-Cladonia sub-communities come especially close to the heath in their floristics. Further south, on the commons of the wetter Weald, the Potentilla-Galium sub-community becomes frequent and its usual sub-shrub companion is the Calluna-Ulex minor heath; and then, in the South-West Peninsula, along the Welsh coast, up the Marches and around the south-western Pennine fringes, this is replaced by the Calluna-Ulex gallii heath, a community which recurs in close association with the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland at scattered localities around the East Anglian coast. The Hypochoeris sub-community is also found with the Calluna-Ulex gallii heath in some of its cliff-top stations around the south-western seaboard, where the sub-shrub vegetation is often of the Scilla sub-community. Such situations are scarcely maritime in the strict sense and, where there is any salt-spray influence, the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland is replaced by the Armeria-Cerastium maritime therophyte community. All these sub-shrub communities are dry heaths and the various kinds of Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland essentially represent their herbaceous element, in which the ericoids and gorse species are kept in check by the continual predation of herbivores. The proportions of grassland and heath at any site, and the sharpness of the boundaries between the vegetation types, are thus ultimately dependent upon the disposition and intensity of the grazing, with burning episodes offering periodic opportunities for the grassland to gain ascendancy over the heath on shallower soils where pasturing after the fire is heavy. Even then, however, the parched and impoverished character of the ground prevents the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland developing the kind of vigorous post-burn sward that is produced over moister soils in central southern and south-western heaths by Agrostis curtisii. Except in very extreme situations, the continuing open nature of the vegetation means that, if grazing and burning cease, colonisation by woody plants tolerant of the dry and oligotrophic conditions readily occurs. With the almost universal abandonment of traditional heath management, then, and after the demise of rabbits, the contribution of the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland has generally shrunk, with a spread of heath and direct invasion of the sward by Betula pendula and pines, these latter able to seed in from nearby plantations, with Quercus robur sometimes appearing or, more locally, as at Sandringham Warren, Rhododendron ponticum. Even where the shade is not too dense, the grassland species mostly succumb quite quickly and there is little doubt that most stands of the community would progress eventually to Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland, the climax forest of acid and free-draining soils through lowland Britain and variously dominated by oak, birch or pine. The other very common element of the neglected heath landscape is bracken, although Pteridium aquilinum tends to avoid soils subject to pronounced parching and to make little headway in direct expansion into the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland. Typically, then, the community now persists mainly on patches of more inhospitable ground where invaders cannot flourish, along pathways and around trampled picnic spots and viewing points among dense patchworks of rank heath, bracken and woodland. Periodic disturbance may allow a resurgence of the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland but, where the ground becomes enriched, such places are likely to be directly invaded by Ulex europaeus to form Ulex-Rubus scrub, or by brambles to produce Rubus-Holcus or Pteridium-Rubus underscrub, or by rank grasses and tall herbs, all of which shade out the smaller plants of the grassland. Towards the wetter part of its range, it is often among such vegetation types as these that the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland persists in rocky field corners and in the disturbed ground around settlements, forming part of the untidy patchwork of semi-natural vegetation typical of landscapes which have seen marginal improvement for grazing. Through the drier lowlands, reclamation has been more extensive and drastic, though it often came late because of the inherent difficulties which the soils pose for good cropping, being lime- and often copper-deficient, droughty and liable to wind erosion. But they are readily cultivated and, particularly in East Anglia, have often gone to arable, mostly for sugar-beet and barley (Hodge et al. 1984). Afforestation has also been an attractive alternative where agricultural yields are low and, in the first 30 years of its existence, the Forestry Commission had acquired 40% of Breckland where by far the largest and most interesting stands of the community survived. There, then, the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland often remains as fragments on the wider sandy ridges between plantations of pine, or in the corners of ploughed fields which have escaped planting and treatment with chemical fertilisers and herbicides. Stands taken in to airfields and military training grounds sometimes preserve more extensive and semi-natural zonations and mosaics by virtue of the prohibition on such improving activities, and the community can develop over a surprising range of man-made surfaces there. Within urban or industrial areas, too, in the warm dry lowlands, the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland can occur over sharply-draining derelict ground among a wide variety of more eutrophic grasslands, tall-herb vegetation and scrub. Where the most extensive stands of the community remain, in parts of Breckland, there is the additional striking influence of variations in base-richness among the sharply-draining, impoverished soils depending on the proximity to the surface of the underlying Chalk and the amount of calcareous material among the superficials (Figure 31). Such differences exert the major control over the renowned suite of grass-heaths, first fully described by Watt (1936,1940), and grouped in this scheme within the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland (Watt’s A and B swards) and the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland (D–G). The zonations, which can be seen still in whole or part, on the Lakenheath–Elveden, Icklingham and Stanford-Wretham heaths (Ratcliffe 1977), run from the most calcifuge swards on Redlodge humoferric podzols, through transitions over Worlington and Methwold sands, to the most calcicole on Newmarket brown rendzinas (Corbett 1973, Hodge et al. 1984). Where Calluna-Festuca heath occupies the more acidic profiles, its boundaries are generally very obvious but zonations among the grasslands can be very gradual or form complex mosaics, often depending directly on heterogeneity in the superficials; where grazing has been relaxed, the boundaries often become further blurred by expansion throughout of F. ovina. Even in the close-cropped swards, some of the perennials and many of the ephemerals and cryptogams run throughout but the preference of Thymus praecox, T. pulegioides, Leontodon hispidus, Cirsium acaule, Sanguisorba minor, Avenula pratensis and, less obviously, Koeleria macrantha, is for the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland; and that of Rumex acetosella, Teesdalia and Galium saxatile is for the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland. In some Breckland sites, too, Carex arenaria can become prominent among these mosaics, marking a shift to Carex or Carex-Cladonia dune communities where sand has been eroded and re-deposited (Watt 1937, Noble 1982), with some possibility of redevelopment of the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland over stabilised surfaces (Watt 1938). Similar zonations can be seen at scattered localities around the East Anglian coast, too.""",
    'u2':   """The Deschampsia grassland is most often found with sub-shrub vegetation, woodland, scrub and bracken in mosaics which reflect complex histories of land use, particularly forest clearance, burning and grazing, and on lowland heaths it now often makes but a small contribution to remnants of semi-natural vegetation where neglect is the major controlling factor in community distribution. Soil-related sequences can sometimes still be discerned beneath the seral patterns, with the Deschampsia grassland occupying a transitional position between wet heath and ephemeral-rich grassland. Around the upland fringes, the patterns are essentially the same, though the particular vegetation types involved can be different and here, too, the grassland can occur in close association with mire communities. In The Weald, in such places as Iping Common in Sussex, Thursley, Hankley and Chobham Commons in Surrey (Ratcliffe 1977) and over some of the remaining open spaces around London, the Deschampsia grassland forms an integral part of the patchwork of communities that has developed over the more free-draining base-poor soils with the abandonment of burning, grazing and other traditional treatments like the cutting of bracken and gorse. Much of the ground is now occupied by what was early referred to as ‘oak-birch heath’ (Tansley 1911, 1939, Wooldridge & Goldring 1953), that is, open, immature Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland with local dominance by a variety of invading trees. Birch, usually B. pendula, oak, mostly Q. robur but with Q. petraea locally abundant, and pine, particularly P. sylvestris but with other species seeding in from planted stock, are all important. And, on some Surrey sites, the naturalised alien Amelanchier lamarkii has gained a hold in such mosaics. In certain places, as on Holmbury and Leith Hill, dead heather and gorse among the woodland litter shows that such vegetation has succeeded heath over the past 40 years or so, while elsewhere trees have invaded more open ground directly after burning episodes. In other sites, there is overgrown Calluna-Ulex minor heath, dense bracken or, where there has been some disturbance and enrichment of the soils, Ulex-Rubus scrub. Among these mosaics, the Deschampsia grassland is sometimes limited to the margins of well-worn paths or remnants of more open ground where woody plants have not yet got a hold in the rank sward, and periodic fires can help re-instate the community in such situations. Sometimes, the stands are a little more extensive, but throughout there is always a strong floristic continuity among the various vegetation types represented, D. flexuosa itself running on under more open canopies of sub-shrubs and trees, together with herbs like Potentilia erecta and Galium saxatile, and the boundaries between the communities being often dependent upon the extent of the cover of woody plants. Frequently, now, the extent of this regrowth is sufficient to blur any soil-related patterns in which the Deschampsia grassland is involved, but it can sometimes be seen as a partial replacement for the Calluna-Ulex heath in the sequences of communities over soils that are increasingly impeded. Then it gives way, where there is any strong tendency to gleying, to the Ericetum tetralicis wet-heath on periodically waterlogged peaty profiles. Such conditions are inimical to the survival of D. flexuosa, although where the surrounds of valley mires in this part of Britain have become dry and been burned the community can extend a little further than usual on to such ground. However, where there is any tendency for grass-dominance to develop in such situations westwards of The Weald, Agrostis curtisii usually has the edge on D. flexuosa, and the Deschampsia grassland fades in importance in the extreme oceanic zone. Shifting in the other direction in these edaphic sequences, on to base-poor soils that show a stronger tendency to parching than is usual under the Deschampsia grassland, there can be a local transition to the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland, usually, in The Weald, of the Potentilla-Galium sub-community. In the past, severe rabbit-grazing helped accentuate the contribution from this vegetation over scuffed patches and around burrows. Essentially similar mosaics of grassland, heath and woodland such as characterise The Weald can be found locally through the Midlands in such sites as Sherwood and Delamere Forests and over the higher ground in Cannock Chase, though here the sub-shrub vegetation is represented by the Calluna-Deschampsia heath, a community which shows an even greater floristic continuity with the Deschampsia grassland than does the Calluna-Ulex minor heath. Birch, oak and pine remain the major colonisers of the more open vegetation with Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland eventually establishing itself as the climax forest. With the shift to the upland fringes, some further changes can be seen in this basic pattern. The Festuca-Agrostis sub-community of the Deschampsia grassland is replaced by the Vaccinium sub-community, and there are similar shifts in both the associated heath and woodland types, with bilberry-rich sub-communities becoming the norm, thus giving a somewhat montane character to the entire sequence of vegetation types. Usually these are disposed over the scarps and valley sides that mark the first substantial rise to the Pennine uplands, the mosaic of communities being again largely dependent on the history of treatments, with a widespread continuance of grazing helping to maintain extensive tracts of the Deschampsia grassland against the spread of sub-shrubs and trees. Patches of grassland and heath can recur at quite high altitudes on the grit edges, though wherever there is a lessening of slope with the shift on to the great shelving dips, poor drainage and the accumulation of ombrogenous peat curtail the extent of these communities. A common pattern is for the Deschampsia grassland to give way to Nardus-Galium grassland on the stagnopodzol intergrades, a zonation which can be interrupted by the occurrence of flushed areas with poor-fen vegetation like grassy Carex-Sphagnum mire, and then for there to be a switch to Calluna-Eriophorum bog. D. flexuosa can run throughout such sequences and, indeed, where blanket peats have been drained, the Deschampsia grassland itself can become established on the drier fringes and ramparts, with a local spread of V. myrtillus where grazing is withdrawn or of the unpalatable E. nigrum ssp. nigrum. The Deschampsia grassland can also figure over the drying surfaces of raised mires with the Eriophorum bog, though with the shift into more oceanic areas it is Molinia which usually assumes dominance with the loss of waterlogging on the bog surface.""",
    'u3':   """The Agrostis grassland is a treatment-derived replacement for various heath communities that characteristically occur in zonations of sub-shrub and mire vegetation developed in relation to drainage impedence, often with bracken, sometimes with other grasslands, scrub and woodland reflecting different responses to particular histories of burning, grazing and disturbance. Generally, at lower altitudes, it is found as a local, and often temporary, element on the sequences of communities around valley mires. On higher ground, it can also form part of the fringing zone of grasslands and heaths around the blanket bog of the summits, and here it may become a more permanent component of upland pasture. The particular communities involved in the lowland sequence vary according to the locality. In the New Forest, where the classic pattern of valley-mire vegetation types described by Rose (1953) can still be widely seen around the elongated hollows eroded into the cover of sands and gravel, the Agrostis grassland is usually found as a replacement for stretches of the Ulex minor-Agrostis heath, sandwiched between the Calluna-U. minor heath of sharply-draining podzols and the Ericetum tetralicis on seasonally-waterlogged soils. In the former direction, A. curtisii can extend some little way if there is local impedence in profiles with much clay below or an iron pan; in the latter, it is quickly extinguished, except where slight soligenous influence ameliorates the lack of aeration, though then Molinia can out-compete it. Full sequences, in which the zonation continues downslope into the Narthecio-Sphagnetum valley bog, occur on Cranesmoor, Denny, Holmsley and Wilverley bogs (Newbould 1960, Ratcliffe 1977, Tubbs 1986), but extensive patchworks of the heaths with Agrostis grassland are to be seen over the terraces and undulating lower ground of the southern part of the forest (Lambert & Manners 1964, Fisher 1975a, b), with deposits of Brick Earth providing a particularly congenial substrate for the grass to get a firm hold (Tubbs 1986). Moving westwards, the New Forest pattern is repeated in its essential features, though on not nearly so extensive a scale, on the Hartland-Arne and Studland-Godlingston heaths, the largest remnants of the once extensive continuation of heathland vegetation around Poole (N. W. Moore 1962, Webb 1986). Then, with the move on to the next most important area of this kind of vegetation, on the Devonsire Pebble-Bed commons, the Ulex minor-Agrostis heath is replaced by the Ulex gallii-Agrostis heath as the usual progenitor of the Agrostis grassland, with the Calluna-U. gallii heath appearing as the characteristic dry sub-shrub community in the sequence. Aylesbeare Common has some good zonations of this kind (Ivimey-Cook et al. 1975), with the interesting complication of soligenous Schoenus-Narthecium mire along soakways, and Cirsio-Molinietum and Molinia-Potentilla mire over the lightly-flushed slopes around. In these kinds of system, the base-enrichment is usually very slight and dependent on sub-surface drainage from limy strata. On The Lizard, however, the Agrostis grassland can be found as a replacement for the U. gallii-Agrostis heath in close juxtaposition with vegetation whose character is determined by the serpentine and gabbro which give rise to soils that are lime-poor but base-rich. Here, the community and its heath progenitor mark out patches of loess and Crousa Gravels that mask the influence of the underlying bedrocks. Over the deeper deposits, E. vagans cannot grow but, where the drift cover thins, there can be some striking vegetation transitional to the E. vagans-Schoenus heath of the gleyed profiles developed from the igneous parent materials (Coombe & Frost 1956a, Hopkins 1983). A. curtisii can also gain a locally dominant hold in loess-contaminated soils transitional to the free-draining brown earths which, around the cliff-top margins of The Lizard, have the other endemic sub-shrub community of the area, the E. vagans-U. europaeus heath (Hopkins 1983). Moving to the wetter and cooler climate of the high ground in the South-West Peninsula, the U. gallii-Agrostis heath continues a strong representation around the fringes of Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor and Exmoor and, together with derived stretches of Agrostis grassland, it can be found around the topogenous hollows and their associated water-tracks that drain radially from the summits. Here, though, there tends to be a shift in the whole character of the vegetation towards the submontane with some kind of Scirpus-Erica wet heath replacing the Ericetum tetralicis on the wetter ground or rush-dominated Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire along soakways. Then, towards drier ground, it is bilberry rather than gorse which often provides the most obvious floristic continuity from the Agrostis grassland to the dry sub-shrub vegetation, which is here often represented by the Calluna-Vaccinium heath occurring on brown podzolic soils and rankers, frequently on steep rocky slopes. Also here, though, the Agrostis grassland and the U. gallii-Agrostis heath can be seen as part of the larger-scale zonation which runs, in crudely concentric fashion, around the blocks of higher ground. Above, on intergrade stagnopodzols and stagnohumic gleys developed over the edge of the summit plateaus, there is a transition to Scirpus-Erica wet heath and then, over the deeper ombrogenous peat, to Scirpus-Eriophorum blanket mire. This kind of pattern is best developed over Dartmoor and well illustrated in the map and descriptions of Ward et al. (1972a), though less extensive and clear zonations can also be seen over the other major upland areas of the south-west. The clarity of definition of the Agrostis grassland among the heaths which immediately give rise to it and the neighbouring sub-shrub communities is largely a function of the treatment the vegetation has received. The impact of a recent burn or the effect of a sharp grazing boundary can be very clear, with an abrupt switch in dominance from the grass to the particular assemblage of sub-shrubs, but often the zonations are much less well defined, where recovery from burning is well advanced or where grazing is light or sporadic. In previous accounts, ‘grass-heath’ categories have sometimes been devised to cater for difficult intermediates or fine mosaics (Ward et al. 1972a, Tubbs 1986) and, in this scheme, the U. minor-Agrostis, U. gallii-Agrostis and E. vagans-Ulex heaths all have sub-communities in which A. curtisii is especially abundant in relation to the woody plants: it should always be remembered that variation among these elements is virtually continuous. Then, there are other developments which can supervene as a result of the perturbations produced by different treatments and these can complicate the basic patterns described above. In the first place, on soils which are a little moister than usual, but well aerated, a situation often associated with some slight sub-surface through-put in heaths on sloping ground, Molinia often has a better start in regeneration than has A. curtisii. Although this grass is much more palatable than the bent, indeed it often provides the best early bite of all in burned heaths, it too can quickly become abundant after fires. Stands in which the grasses are co-dominant can still be included here but, where Molinia is clearly in the ascendancy, the vegetation is best placed in the Anthoxanthum sub-community of the Molinia-Potentilla mire. This can frequently be found with stands of the Agrostis grassland and many of the herbaceous associates are the same, the boundary between the communities being often dependent on the relative abundance of the two grasses. Nardus stricta, on the other hand, which is so abundant in poor-quality grazings over the ill-drained upland areas through Wales and northern Britain, does not seem to present much challenge to A. curtisii in some parts of the south-west, notably Dartmoor, even on the peaty intergrades. It has been suggested that this is because the plant is kept in check by a diversity of grazing stock, particularly by the ponies which bite the heart out of the tufts (Havinden & Wilkinson 1970, Ward et al. 1972a). A second development can be seen where the soils are well drained but somewhat more base-rich than is usual where A. curtisii flourishes. Then, after burning or under the influence of long, hard grazing alone, grasses such as Festuca ovina, Agrostis capillaris and Anthoxanthum can become co-dominant in a Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland. Sometimes, such swards develop on distinct patches of brown earth soils, perhaps maintained by flushing, as over the highest northern terraces of the New Forest, or where the stretches of heath abut on to stream sides, woodland margins, roadside verges or the edges of settlements where pH can remain low but where there is some measure of enrichment from flooding, leaf-fall and dunging. A. curtisii sometimes persists in such grasslands but only in small amounts and the distinction between the communities is often clear, particularly where more mesophytic grasses and dicotyledons get a hold. In the New Forest, this kind of vegetation makes up the best grazing on the drier ‘lawns’, where liming has been used in some places to enhance the quality of the herbage further, with the development of particularly rich Lolio-Cynosuretum and Lolio-Plantaginetum grasslands (Tubbs 1986). Although of highly artificial origin, these vegetation types form a very interesting local series grading continuously into Agrostis grassland. Around the upland fringes, such diversity is uncommon but, on Dartmoor, the Agrostis grassland occurs widely in mosaics with Festuca-Agrostis-Galium swards on brown podzolic soils and it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish the two (Tansley 1939, Ward et al. 1972a). Where more mesotrophic brown earths with these grasslands have had some modest disturbance, Ulex europaeus often invades and patches of Ulex-Rubus scrub, developing where grazing is light, often mark out old (sometimes very old) field boundaries and settlements among stretches of Agrostis grassland. On deeper soils with free drainage, though, a more likely development after fires or where sheep alone are grazed, is for bracken to spread. A. curtisii can persist under a quite dense cover of the fronds (Ivimey-Cook 1959) but, where invasion is very vigorous, as over stoneless colluvial soils, the Pteridium-Galium community becomes established. Cutting can push back the succession and, combined with grazing, particularly if heavier-trampling cattle and ponies are used, re-establish Agrostis grassland (Tubbs 1986).""",
    'u4':   """Through the open grazings of the sub-montane west and north of Britain, the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland can be found with a great variety of other grasslands, heaths and mires, in diverse patchworks that reflect differences in regional climate across its wide range, and variations in soils and treatments over particular stretches of hills. Grazing is of prime importance in preventing the regression of the community to woody vegetation and, though it is possible that towards its very highest limits some stands would revert to climax heath, most would be succeeded by scrub and woodland if treatment ceased. In altitudinal sequences, then, this is a community of the forest zone and sub-alpine transition, limited above by the harsh climate and now curtailed below by enclosure and improvement. The Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland makes its maximum contribution to upland rough grazings on the well-drained, acidic soils characteristic of steeper slopes underlain by lime-poor substrates, and some of the commonest zonations in which it is seen are related to shifts from these favoured geological, topographic and edaphic conditions, particularly as they affect the moisture regime, base-status and trophic state of the soils. For example, the community often extends on to shallow rankers, provided these are not disposed among boulders or on ledges inaccessible to grazing stock, where shrubs and trees can invade, but where there is any tendency for such soils to become parched in dry weather, the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland is usually replaced by more fragmentary swards of the Thero-Airion type. Such transitions are best seen over small, fractured rock outcrops around the drier southern and eastern fringes of the uplands (Jarvis 1974, Sinker et al. 1985, Hughes & Huntley 1986), though they persist locally in wetter regions on warmer, south-facing slopes (Birse 1980), and they often involve a switch to the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland. In such situations, the thinning and increased droughtiness of the soil cover is marked by a change to a more open and tussocky turf, lacking such species as Anthoxanthum, Potentilla erecta, Luzula campestris and Viola riviniana, together with the bulky pleurocarpous mosses, but gaining plants like Rumex acetosella, Aira praecox, Poa annua and other ephemerals, Sedum anglicum and acrocarpous mosses. the bulky pleurocarpous mosses, but gaining plants like Rumex acetosella, Aira praecox, Poa annua and other ephemerals, Sedum anglicum and acrocarpous mosses. Much more extensive and important, though, are those patterns related to increased moisture of the soil, which can be a function of higher precipitation and run-off, flushing or drainage impedence. Sometimes the changes are fairly subtle, relating to a slight lessening of slope and accumulation of downwashed colluvial material, when the deeper and better integrated profiles can be marked just by a shift from Typical Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland to the more mesophytic Holcus-Trifolium sub-community. A similar change, sometimes amounting to little more than a rise in the frequency of H. lanatus, T. repens, Achillea millefolium and Cerastium fontanum, can accompany the move from arenaceous parent materials to more argillaceous ones, quite a slight increase of clay in the profile being sufficient to slow down leaching, raise the base-status a little and improve the texture. Such patterns can be seen where the sandstones are replaced by shales in sequences of Devonian, Silurian and Carboniferous rocks such as underlie much of south-west England, Wales and the Southern Uplands, the change in geology often being matched by a shift from steeper and craggier slopes to more gentle ground. Or, where slopes lessen, there can be smears of clayey drift which mask the controlling influence of pervious sandstones. In all these cases, the move from shedding towards receiving drainage helps confirm the lithological influence of the parent materials. Very commonly, however, the impedence of run-off in situations like this is such as to effect a more marked floristic change. Characteristically, over the lower ground through the uplands, high rainfall and water shed from surrounding hills induces surface-water gleying over impermeable substrates on gentle slopes, brown earths or podzolised profiles being replaced by stagnogleys or where, in impeded hollows, there is some shallow fluctuation of the water-table, by ground-water gleys. Then, the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland typically gives way to the Juncus-Galium mire, physiognomically a rush-pasture, dominated by clumps of J. acutiflorus or J. effusus, and with such Molinietalia associates as Galium palustre, Cirsium palustre, Lotus uliginosus, Ranunculus flammula and Angelica sylvestris. Sometimes, where the underlying edaphic differences are sharp, the floristic junctions are correspondingly abrupt, but where it is drift that is the primary control on drainage, then the changes are much more gradual. Boundaries can be further blurred where, as is usually the case, stock have access, when an ill-defined mosaic of vegetation types is produced among the clumps of unpalatable rushes. Receiving most of the attention of the grazing stock, the swards between get a concentration of dung and then a Cynosurion element can become prominent in the transition, with the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community surrounding the clumps of rush-pasture and giving way on steeper slopes to Typical Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland. There can be a marked drift of more mesophytic plants in such situations, with species like Festuca rubra, H. lanatus and T. repens well represented throughout. Very often, too, patchworks of this kind have been further improved by draining of the wetter ground, with the consequent expansion of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, the application of artificials like basic slag helping to maintain higher fertility and favouring the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community. Much pasture upgraded in this way has been taken in towards the limits of enclosure and sometimes given more assiduous improvement, but neglect can allow quite rapid reversion to a rush-pasture mosaic where the drains become blocked, and the toing and froing of land around the fringes of the uplands between these vegetation types is often a reflection of the state of the agricultural economy. Mixtures of the communities figure prominently in the pastures described from the Cheviots by King (1962; see also King & Nicholson 1964) and very extensive tracts occur over the undulating foothills of central Wales and the Southern Uplands. western and northern Britain. In some such situations, the zonations described above form just part of extensive vegetation sequences which run on into Ericion wet heath and Erico-Sphagnion blanket mire on thickening ombrogenous peat that has developed over increasingly gentle slopes, running back from scarps to shelving dips, up from steep slopes on to high-altitude plateaus or down to low-level benches. In other cases, the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture forms a transition zone on the gleyed surrounds to water-tracks and flushes running through Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, a common feature where steeper hill slopes channel runoff into juvenile streams or where impermeable rocks or drift bring soil waters to the surface within stretches of open pasture. Then, the Juncus-Galium vegetation usually gives way in turn to a strip of rush-dominated Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire over the irrigated peaty soil but grazing and trampling can fret the boundaries of these zonations and maintain patches of grassy sward among clumps of rushes in close juxtaposition with the Sphagnum carpet of the flushed ground. A frequent complication of these kinds of soil-related patterns where the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland occurs among better-aerated peaty profiles at lower altitudes in the western part of its range is the spread of Molinia. In contrast to the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture, the Molinia-Potentilla mire, which contains most of the Molinia-dominated swards in this part of the country, is characteristically associated with areas of quickening drainage through peaty mineral soils and true peats, and it can often be seen among stretches of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland towards the western seaboard of Britain, around the heads and sides of moorland streams and fringing soligenous and basin mires (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Ratcliffe & Hattey 1982). In such edaphic and climatic conditions, Molina can be very vigorous, its dominance marking out the boundary between one vegetation type and the other quite clearly, but where the Molinia-Potentilla mire has been burned and grazed, a common practice, continuing predation by stock can maintain fairly short and diverse swards over the peatier soils, and the floristic continuity is then considerable. The Anthoxanthum sub-community of the Molinia-Potentilla mire, for example, has frequent Anthoxanthum, Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra, Holcus lanatus and Potentilla erecta, and occurs very extensively with Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland in Wales and southwest Scotland. Similar vegetation can also be found over shallow ombrogenous peats where wet heath has been transformed into grassy Molinia mire by burning and grazing. In the cool and wet conditions at higher altitudes, the spread of Nardus presents a different complication to the picture. This grass is of varying frequency through the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland and its abundance is always strongly influenced by the treatments which the swards have received. But edaphically, it competes least well on the well-drained moder and mull soils characteristic of the Typical and Holcus-Trifolium sub-communities, rather better on some of the cold humic gleys that, in the western Highlands, can carry the Luzula-Rhytidiadelphus sub-community, and best of all on profiles which combine a humose topsoil with a strongly-leached and oligotrophic mineral base, often gleyed (e.g. Pearsall 1968). In some of the transitions already mentioned, Nardus can increase its cover where there is a tendency for such soils to develop, so that a zone of Nardus-Galium grassland becomes interposed in the sequences: this can happen over much-trampled transitions between the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland and Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire towards higher altitudes, where the community gives way to ill-drained stretches of Molinia-Potentilla mire, and where, over redistributed peat washed down from above, there is a zonation to run-down wet heath and blanket mire (e.g. Smith 1918). Very frequently, too, Nardus spreads within the Vaccinium-Deschampsia sub-community where it extends on to humic stagnopodzols, a common feature on drift-smeared slopes at higher altitudes, and then there can be a patchy mosaic of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium and Nardus-Galium grasslands. In such situations, the latter community is often readily picked out in winter by the abundant bleached herbage of the matgrass but the two vegetation types have many associates in common: Festuca ovina, Agrostis capillaris, Deschampsia flexuosa, Potentilla erecta, Galium saxatile, Vaccinium myrtillus and pleurocarpous mosses all provide strong continuity through the swards. It has been suggested (Heddle & Ogg 1936, Fenton 1937, Harris 1939) that the spread of Nardus into the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland in situations such as these is a consequence of the historical switch from cattle to sheep as the major grazing stock and, more recently, from wethers to the more selective breeding ewes (Roberts 1959, Grant et al. 1985). Where Nardus is becoming entrenched, it may thus now require densities of sheep to control it which are unacceptably high for the continued health of the better-quality Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland (Nicholson et al. 1970), such that the matgrass continues its advance or becomes firmly entrenched in sharply-defined mosaics. In all of the zonations described so far, there is generally a marked poverty of bases in all the soils, but different kinds of pattern can be seen where this situation is relieved, either by some change in parent materials or by irrigation of the profiles by lime-rich waters. Through most of its range, the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland is replaced in such circumstances by the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, a community with which it shares many catholic and mildly calcifuge herbs, but where there is fairly consistent enrichment with plants such as Thymus praecox, Carex panicea, C. pulicaris, Selaginella selaginoides and calcicolous bryophytes. The two vegetation types come closest over drier soils, as where there is a change from brown earths of low base-status to those with a higher pH and calcium content where, say, limy partings occur among base-deficient shales or a drift cover thins over native calcareous rocks: then, the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland is usually represented by the Trifolium-Luzula sub-community which can grade almost imperceptibly into Typical Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland or the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community. More striking patterns are to be seen around base-rich flushes where, within the space of a few metres, there can be a transition from Typical Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland over the unirrigated sopes, through the Carex sub-community of the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland to a Caricion davallianae mire on a calcareous gley, with perhaps a Cratoneurion spring at its head. At moderate altitudes through the northern part of the range of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, the small-sedge mire vegetation in such zonations is usually of the Pinguiculo-Caricetum type, with the Carici-Saxifragetum replacing it in stony flushes over higher ground. At higher altitudes, too, over moderately base-rich mulls through the Scottish Highlands, the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath can figure in such sequences. Alchemilla alpina and T. praecox are good indicators of transitions to this kind of vegetation with, in moister situations, basiphilous small sedges but, again, there can be considerable floristic continuity through the swards. With the move southwards into the Craven district, it is the Sesleria-Galium grassland that constitutes the more calcicolous element in grassland patchworks of this type, marking out extensive stretches of calcareous lithomorphic soils, with the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland limited to places where surface leaching of native profiles is more pronounced or where the influence of the underlying bedrock is masked by light-textured drift. A comparable situation pertains in the Derbyshire Dales, towards the south-eastern limit of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, although here the climate is sufficiently warm and dry for the Festuca-Avenula grassland to occupy the rendzina soils on the steeper valley sides, with the distinctive Lathyrus-Stachys sub-community of the more calcifuge grassland marking out the loess-contaminated soils on the brow tops (Balme 1953, Pigott 1962, Grime 1963a, b). More natural sequences here can run on into the Vaccinium-Deschampsia sub-community with D. flexuosa showing a tendency to invade and acidify the shallower and less base-poor soils and consequently modifying the floristics and structure of the Lathyrus-Stachys sub-community (Grime 1963b, Pigott 1970a) but, in many places, the deeper soils of the plateau have been improved so that, beyond a field boundary, there is often a sharp change to the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community or a Cynosurion sward. In all these patterns, grazing is usually the major factor in preventing the reversion of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland and the other plagioclimax swards with which it occurs to the different kinds of forest from which they were, in the main, originally derived. The effects of a reduction in grazing pressure are widely seen among tracts of the community where the ground becomes naturally less accessible to the stock, as where there are tumbles of blocky talus over the slopes, or where crags and ravines interrupt the landscape, although in such places the change in topography often affects soil development and climate, so that the transitions to lush herbaceous or woody vegetation seen there are usually of complex origin. More obviously seral are those situations where stock have been temporarily or permanently withdrawn from the open pastures, reflecting the fate of local farming enterprises or the vicissitudes of the agricultural economy as a whole, with a neglect of the grazings or enclosure for alternative purposes such as forestry or water resource management. In fact, the continuing high value of the better-quality elements among our rough pastures, like the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, means that such opportunities for succession are fairly scarce. Where they do occur, the first invaders are often birch, usually Betula pubescens but with B. pendula locally prominent in some places, as through parts of east-central Scotland, and Sorbus aucuparia, with pines frequently seeding in from plantations, and oaks, generally Quercus petraea but locally Q. robur, sometimes coming in later (Pearsall & Pennington 1973). On the more base-poor and rocky soils supporting the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, such species would probably eventually come to dominate in the kind of vegetation we see in the Quereus-Betula-Dicranum woodland, the field layer of which can present virtually identical mixtures of plants to those found here in the Vaccinium-Deschampsia sub-community and some of the more unremittingly calcifuge Typical stands. Over less impoverished soils on to which the grassland extends, where Corylus avellana or even Crataegus monogyna can sometimes be found among the early colonisers after withdrawal of grazing, the seral trend is probably towards the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland, a forest type whose herbaceous element is akin to the more mesophytic Festuca-Agrostis-Galium swards, such as are included in the Typical, Holcus-Trifolium and Luzula-Rhytidiadelphus sub-communities. Both these woodland communities are widespread through the northern and western submontane zone of Britain and can often be seen in close association with the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, though not commonly in active successional development from it. More commonly, the woodlands occur as an enclosed element in the landscape towards the lower altitudinal limits of the grassland or extend up through it in fragmentary fashion in inaccessible ravines. Or, they are open to the stock, offering valuable sheltered grazing in hard weather and often being in the later stages of conversion back to pasture after a period of enclosure for coppicing, rarely practised now: such woodlands, with their characteristically grassy field layers, are often essentially Festuca-Agrostis-Galium swards with a canopy of over-mature trees. Even where there are reductions in grazing of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, however, the progression to woodland is by no means assured. In the first place, seed-parents of some important potential invaders, like the oaks, are very scarce through much of the sub-montane zone. Others, like the birches and pines, whose seed is numerous and widely dispersed by the wind, need an open well-lit turf for establishment, and suitable conditions can be very short-lived before the development of a rank tussocky sward precludes further establishment. Then, there is the possibility of expansion of sub-shrubs previously held in check but readily able to form a heathy cover in which trees can get a hold only with difficulty. Calluna and V. myrtillus can both be found with varying degrees of frequency as sparse sprigs in the sward and can become important dominants in heaths developed from Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland with, less commonly, Ulex minor, U. gallii, Erica cinerea and Empetrum nigrum ssp. nigrum playing a part in various parts of the range. Through the sub-montane zone, the community is found very commonly in mosaics with various kinds of heath, the balance between burning and grazing playing a controlling role in determining their proportions as plagioclimax replacements for forest and the direction of successional shifts between them. The Calluna-Ulex minor heath in the New Forest and around Poole Harbour towards the south-eastern climatic limit of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, the Calluna-Ulex gallii heath at lower altitudes through the south-west of England and Wales, the Calluna-Erica cinerea heath in the western parts of Scotland, the Calluna-Scilla heath around the maritime fringe, the Calluna-Vaccinium heath in the less oceanic parts of the sub-montane zone and the Calluna-Deschampsia heath through the polluted southern Pennines – all these can occur in patchworks with or gradations to the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland and some of them have distinct sub-communities representing spatial or seral transitions to it. Towards its highest altitudinal limits, the community can also be found with the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath and it is possible that, just beyond the forest zone, this is an original precursor to high-level stands. Another shrub which commonly features in Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland towards lower altitudes is Ulex europaeus and transitions to patches of Ulex-Rubus scrub often mark out the sites of old settlements or disturbed boundary banks in tracts of the pasture, pathways through it or enclosures which have passed in and out of intensive use for grazing. The other highly significant development which can supervene in the regression of neglected Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland is the spread of Pteridium aquilinum. Typically, through the sub-montane zone, this fern grows most vigorously on colluvial soils, over which it is abundant in the two kinds of woodland from which the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland has commonly developed. Many of the slope-foot stands of dense Pteridium-Galium vegetation to be seen today throughout the unenclosed rough grazings of the uplands no doubt derive directly from the field layers of cleared forest, but bracken has increased its extent very considerably through what were once open pastures. Changes in treatment are certainly partly to blame for this: bracken is no longer cut as it once was for bedding, and the shift towards grazing almost exclusively with sheep means that the advancing fronts of fronds no longer get the heavy trampling that cattle used to give them. Transitions between the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland and the Pteridium-Galium vegetation can be very gradual, and species such as Potentilla erecta, Galium saxatile and Dicranum scoparium can run on sparsely under quite dense covers of fronds, but much pasture with bracken is virtually useless once the annual cover of shoots is well grown and the re-establishment of trees where grazing is abandoned completely is well nigh impossible.""",
