"a3","Zonation and succession The community is usually found on smaller, sheltered stretches of open water fringed by but a short or patchy cover of emergents. Other kinds of submerged aquatic vegetation can occur beneath it, and it may persist in fragmentary form among assemblages of floatingleaved macrophytes, but it is readily shaded out by them, and by encroaching swamp communities, relying on repeated cleaning for its continuing survival. Herbicide treatment or pollution, with increased deoxygenation, turbidity and eutrophication of the waters can lead to the replacement of the Spirodela-Hydrocharis vege tation by simpler Lemna communities. In the more open dykes with shelving, stepped or low banks which provide the most typical habitat for the community, and particularly where there is some regular physical cleaning of weed growth, the usual pattern is for the water margins to have a short, though sometimes quite luxurious, cover of Glycerio-Sparganion vege tation. Decumbent clumps of Glyceria fluitans and Agrostis stolonifera, or patches of Berula erecta and Apium nodiflorum, provide floristic continuity with the Spirodela-Hydrocharis community, and there can be scattered plants of Alisma plantago-aquatica or Nasturtium officinale, many of these able to make rapid regrowth if the disturbance has not been too gross. Then, there can be scattered patches of the Sparganie- tum erecti or Sagittaria sagittifolia swamp but, where taller emergents are represented, these tend to occur in clumps which alternate with the Spirodela-Hydrocharis community in less regularly maintained dykes, or to be set back some way from it on a shelving bank. A variety of swamps can be found in such situations, the Phragmi- tetum, the Glycerietum maximae, the Typhetum latifoliae and, in brackish waters, the Scirpetum maritimae, but, wherever these become densely shading, any duckweed vegetation surviving among the shoots tends to be of the impoverished Lemnetum minoris or Lemnetum gibbae.Similarly, where floating-leaved macrophyte vege tation such as the Polygonum amphibium or Nuphar lutea communities develop, these may shade out the submerged elements of the Spirodela-Hydrocharis as semblage and even overwhelm Hydrocharis itself, leav ing just fragmentary and species-poor duckweed mats. Where the waters remain relatively unshaded, however, other submerged aquatic communities can be found with this kind of vegetation, both Ceratophyllum demer- sum and Elodea canadensis being able to thicken up into virtually pure stands without a duckweed mat above them. In other places, the Spirodela-Hydrocharis community has been recorded with the Potamogeton pectinatus-Myriophyllum spicatum vegetation or, in more brackish habitats, the Potamogeton pectinatus community, Ceratophyllum submersi or Ranunculetum baudotii. Physical cleaning can readily allow this richer kind of duckweed vegetation to regenerate, but treatments which pollute, dirty or eutrophicate the waters to any degree will tend to eliminate the submerged species and simplify the assemblage to a floating mat of the Lemnetum minoris or the Lemnetum gibbae, communities which have probably ousted the Spirodela-Hydrocharis vegetation in many once suitable sites throughout its range.
