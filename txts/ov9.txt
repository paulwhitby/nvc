"ov9","Zonation and succession In arable fields and market gardens, the Matricaria-Stel-laria community can occur patchily among the crops or around the field margins, alone or in patchworks with other weed communities characteristic of lighter, fertile soils. Along tracks through fields and in gateways, the community often gives way to the Polygonum-Chamomilla assemblage which is more tolerant of tram-pling.Stands of the Matricaria-Stellaria community on dis-turbed waysides can have a fringe of the Poa-Matricaria vegetation, occur with other eutrophic tall-herb commu-nities like the Urtica-Cirsium assemblage or give way to closed Lolio-Plantaginion swards or the Arrhenathere-tum on verges. Regular disturbance in arable fields prevents any suc-cessional developments but where the community occurs on abandoned ground, it can progress to Lolio-Plantaginion grassland and Rubion sub-scrub.
