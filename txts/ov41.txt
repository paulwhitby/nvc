"ov41","Zonation and succession Where walls have smaller crevices in mortar, the Parieta-rietum can be found with the Cymbalarietum and Asple-nietum communities, where dominance shifts to Cymbalaria or small ferns. In fact, Segal (1969) saw A. ruta-muraria and Cymbalaria as precursors to Parietaria on newly-built or restored walls, being overwhelmed as the latter increased its cover. Where there is local enrich-ment around walls and cliffs, the Parietarietum occurs with the Urtica-Galium community. On coastal shore-banks and cliff-tops, the Daucus sub-community can give way to the Festuca-Daucus grassland with an increase in grass cover and higher fre-quency of herbs like Sanguisorba minor and Plantago lanceolata.
