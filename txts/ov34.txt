"ov34","Zonation and succession The Allium-Plantago community is found most com-monly among stands of the Erica-Ulex heath on The Lizard in situations where the serpentine soils become shallow in rocky ground on the plateaus, on valley sides and in transitions to cliff-tops. In such places the ericoid sub-shrubs and gorse become confined to deeper pockets of soil within cre-vices among the serpentine, are held in check by the shortage of ground water and occasionally killed by severe drought (Hopkins 1983). The consequent lack ofshade and access of stock and rabbits to the sward also help maintain the short and species-rich characteristic of the Festuca sub-community of the Erica-Ulex heath. Here, F. ovina, Thymus praecox, Koeleria macrantha, Scilla verna and Plantago maritima become more common among the heath flora and it is such plants which, together with sparse Calluna, extend a little way into the pans among the rock exposures where theAllium-Plantago community develops. Closer to cliff-tops, as maritime influence increases, the Erica-Ulex heath gives way to the Calluna-Scilla heath, the Viola sub-community of which shares many associates with the grassy form of the inland heath. The Allium-Plantago community can sometimes be found in such transitions but it does not extend far on to the sea-cliffs. Distribution "
