"ov32","Zonation and succession The Ranunculetum scelerati is generally found as small, often fragmentary stands in mosaics and zonations with other inundation vegetation, water-margin communities and wet grasslands, the patterns being related to the extent of inundation, disturbance and enrichment. Where dunging or other forms of eutrophication are absent or very localised around ponds and alongside streams, the community can give way to Rorippa-Filaginella vegetation on somewhat less fertile, periodi-cally-inundated ground. At the water's edge, it frequently gives way to Glycerio-Sparganion assem-blages like the Glycerietum fluitantis or stands domi-nated by Nasturtium officinale agg. or Veronica beccabunga, among which plants like Myosotis scorpi-oides, Alisma plantago-aquatica and Berula erecta can remain locally prominent. Ragged zonations between these mixtures of plants are very common along small lowland streams and ditches through silty and clay soils. In other situations, the Ranunculetum scelerati can pass more directly to swamps like the Glycerietum maximae or to periodically inundated Elymo-Rumicion swards or damp Lolio-Plantaginion leys.
