"sd19","Zonation and succession The Tortulo-Phleetum is characteristically a minor and local element within stretches of more stable dune grasslands. Its distinctive contingent of ephemerals comes and goes as particular locations become congen-ial and it can be rapidly overwhelmed in any one place https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.053 Published online by Cambridge University PressSD19 Tortulo-Phleetum arenariae dune annual community 249 by renewed vigour among the perennials in the sur-rounding swards. Zonations to the Ammophila-Festuca and Festuca-Galium grasslands, the two communities that generally provide the context for this assemblage, involve a thick-ening up of the perennial grasses and recolonisation bydicotyledonous herbs. Where local disturbance becomes more acute, however, for example where rabbit activity loosens the sand surface, there can be renewed erosion and a spread of Carex arenaria or Ammophila vegetation which rapidly overwhelms the Tortulo-Phleetum.
