"sm11","Zonation and succession In the low marsh the association forms a distinct zone above the Salicornietum europaeae or the Spartinetum townsendii or, occasionally, at the most seaward limit. Upwards it passes into the Puccinellietum maritimae or the Halimionetum portulacoidis. Landward boundaries are diffuse and patches of the association are frequently found in the lower part of the zone above. Although A. tripolium var. discoideus can grow at lower levels on the shore than many salt-marsh species, it is not a successful primary coloniser. Gray (1971) has suggested that it has spread in recent years, possibly fol-lowing Spartina anglica invasion of bare substrates, but the evidence for this is inconclusive. At Scolt Head, Norfolk, Chapman (1959) has shown the association developing from the Salicornietum europaeae in about 25 years. Distribution "
