"mg2","Zonation and succession Spatial transitions between the Filipendulo-Arrhenatheretum and other vegetation types are partly controlled by the sharpness of local topographic discontinuities. Stands are often small and fragmentary and confined to ledges and embayments, giving way abruptly on less sheltered, sunnier slopes to the local form of calcicolous grassland. Where the vegetation is open to stock, graz ing may blur the zonation. There is sometimes a gradation to mixed deciduous woodland of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis or Fraxi- nus-Sorbus-Mecurialis types. However, although many sites may formerly have had a more extensive local woodland cover, the broken terrain on which the community is typically found could never have been densely wooded (Pigott 1958). The Filipendulo-Arrhenatheretum should therefore be regarded as a persistent woodland margin community rather than a serai pre cursor. The occasional association of the community with old mixed hedgerows is interesting in this respect. Distribution "
