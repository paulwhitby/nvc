"ov42","Zonation and succession The Cymbalarietum can be found with other kinds of crevice vegetation where walls have been colonised by different mixtures of species tolerant of the extreme con-ditions of the habitat. In the warmer south and east of Britain, the Cymbalarietum can be found with the Parie-tarietum where Parietaria diffusa is the distinctive domi-nant among the crevices, and Segal (1969) saw this as sometimes a successional replacement for the Cymbala-rietum. On more lime-rich mortar on sunlit walls throughout the lowlands, the community can be replaced by the Asplenietum where Cymbalaria is rare or absent and small asplenioids and more calcicolous bryo-phytes and herbs are characteristic.
