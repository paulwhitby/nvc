"ov40","Zonation and succession On shaded rock outcrops in mountains, the Asplenio-Cystopteridetum can often be found growing as isolated fragments in crevices. Where on exposures at higher alti-tudes there is more opportunity for soil accumulation and where seepage keeps the cliff faces dripping wet, the community can be found with the Saxifraga-Alchemilla vegetation, the asplenoid ferns continuing to figure occasionally among the luxuriant herb carpet of that assemblage. On drier ledges and crags, the Dryas-Silene community can also figure, with the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland usually occurring over the grazed slopes around. In the Yorkshire Dales, at somewhat lower altitudes on Carboniferous Limestone, the Asple-nio-Cystopterideturn occurs on crags among the Sesle-ria-Galium grassland and can be seen in the mosaics of vegetation among high level grikes on pavement expo-sures. In sunnier situations at lower altitudes, the com-munity is replaced by the Asplenietum. Distribution "
