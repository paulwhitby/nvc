"ov3","Zonation and succession The Papaveretum is typically seen as a patchy or margi-nal assemblage in parts of cereal fields that have escaped herbicide treatment. On more calcareous soils, it is replaced by the Papaveri-Sileneetum and it can pass to other weed communities like the Veronica or Stellaria-Capsella assemblages where crops have been more heavily fertilised or where more herbicide-resistant species prevail. Where the community occurs on dis-turbed waste ground, it can give way to Urtica-Cirsium vegetation or the Arrhenatheretum where Papaver rhoeas can remain locally frequent.
