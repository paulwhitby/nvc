"s8","Zonation and succession The Scirpetum lacustris represents the deep-water limit of swamp vegetation in Britain and stands may be isolated beyond the more proximal parts of emergent sequences. In larger lakes, where the community is represented by the Scirpus or, in shallower water, the Equisetum sub-community, extensive stretches of open water may occur between the community and inshore swamps. In Scottish lakes, Spence (1964) commonly encountered mixtures of submerged Juncus bulbosus (i.e. J. fluitans Lam.) and Littorella uniflora in this intervening zone and often running out to form, with Sparganium minimum, a distinctive understorey to the Scirpetum. In other cases, the community gave way, in shallower water, to Phragmitetum australis, sometimes with a narrow zone of overlap between the two vegetation types. An essentially similar zonation occurs at Esthwaite in Cumbria (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wilson 1978). It is clear that, at North Fen at Esthwaite, the Scirpetum advanced some 15-30 m into open water between 1915 and 1929 (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939) and, along part of its front, about half this distance between 1929 and 1967 (Pigott & Wilson 1978), giving rates of movement between about 0.5 and 2 m yr -1. At other sites, however, stands have remained more or less unaltered and stationary for at least 50 years (West 1905, Spence 1964: cf. Plates 70 & 71 in Spence 1964) and S. lacustris ssp. lacustris may itself be of little importance in terrestrialisation. In rivers and streams, small and fragmentary stands of the Scirpus sub-community may stand some distance out from the banks in deeper water. On more steeply shelving profiles, the Sparganium sub-community may form part of a narrow transition from open water, through the Sparganietum erecti to the Glycerietum maximae or some form of tail-herb vegetation (Haslam 1978).
