"ov4","Zonation and succession The Spergulo-Chrysanthemetum occurs patchily within and around the edges of arable fields, sometimes giving way to other weed assemblages where there are local shifts in soil conditions, or differences in treatments and crops. In fields on clayey soils in the south-west and in Wales, for example, it tends to be replaced by the Poa annua-Stachys arvensis community and among summer cereals by the Papaveretum. More heavily fertilised or herbicide-treated stretches of crop or fields can see a switch to communities like Matriciaria-Stellaria assem-blage. With the move to the more extreme oceanic climate of the far south-west of England, the Spergulo-Chrysanthemetum is replaced by the Cerastium-Fumaria community on similar soils. Continuing cultivation of arable crops repeatedly creates congenial conditions for the community but tra-ditional alternations of cereals or roots and fallow grass-land, as on the machair of the Outer Hebrides, leads to a temporary successional replacement of the Ranunculus repens sub-community by swards of the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla or Festuca-Galium types (I. Craw-ford, personal communication). Distribution "
