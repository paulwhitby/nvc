"sm23","Zonation and succession Mosaics of the various sub-communities appear to develop in relation to differences in soil salinity levels and the height of the water-table. In coastal sites, the association is usually rather sharply marked off from thesurrounding vegetation, often Juncetum gerardi or Puc-cinellietum maritimae, though in some cases there may be a more gradual transition to a Puccinellietum mariti-mae with large amounts of Puccinellia distans (e.g. the upper reaches of the tidal Nene; Adam & Akeroyd 1978). The association is maintained by continued distur-bance. If this ceases, then a closed sward of the sur-rounding vegetation is likely to extend into the Puccinellietum distantis. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.027 Published online by Cambridge University Press100 Salt-marsh communities Distribution "
