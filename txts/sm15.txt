"sm15","Zonation and succession There is a marked difference in the relative position ofthe association on salt-marshes in south-east England and those elsewhere but lack of submersion data makes it difficult to assess these variations in terms of absolute relationships to tidal levels. On the west and Channel coasts, the association generally occurs at relatively low levels in association with the Spartinetum townsendii or more usually within or at the upper limit of the Pucci-ne Hie turn maritimae. In the south-east, a narrow belt of the association occurs normally between the Puccinel-lietum maritimae, Limonium-Armeria sub-community,and the Atriplici-Elymetumpycnanthi or the tall Festuca rubra sub-community of the Juncetum gerardi. Theassociation grades smoothly into the Puccinellietum which effectively constitutes the understorey of the Juncus-Triglochin vegetation. On those few ungrazed western marshes where the Puccinellietum maritimae, https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.019 Published online by Cambridge University PressSM15 Juncusmaritimus-Triglochin maritima salt-marsh 69 Limonium-Armeria sub-community occurs, the associa-tion occupies the position typical of south-east salt-marshes. In at least one site, Juncus maritimus has been seen as a coloniser with Spartina anglica. Distribution "
