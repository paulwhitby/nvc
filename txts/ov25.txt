"ov25","Zonation and succession The community occurs typically with other weed vegeta-tion or among various grasslands and scrub commu-nities. Invasion by brambles, shrubs and trees can continue or restore a succession to woodland. Among neglected, disturbed or ill-managed pastures and leys, this kind of vegetation can occur very fragmen-tarily around molehills and patches of broken ground, passing sharply to the Lolio-Cynosuretum or Lolio-Plantaginion leys. On grassy waysides and verges, stands can be larger and the context is usually communities likethe Lolium-Dactylis assemblage or the Arrhenatheretum. Along road edges, it can give way to the Poa-Matricaria perforata community. On wasteland, the Urtica-Cirsium community can occur with a variety of other weed vegetation like the Matricaria perforata-Stellaria or Stellaria-Capsella assemblages, in various sub-communities of which both stinging nettle and thistles can remain prominent. Such vegetation types can precede the development of the Urtica-Cirsium community on abandoned arable land or waste ground. Subsequent stages in succession can be seen where ground remains undisturbed or unmanaged. Then, Rubus fruticosus agg. can become more patchily prominent among the Urtica-Cirsium vegetation,thicken up into Rubus-Holcus underscrub and this in turn progress to Crataegus-Hedera scrub. Mosaics of such communities are a common feature of abandoned waste ground and grossly-disturbed woodland clearings and margins. Eventual development of Quercus-Pterid-ium-Rubus or Fagus-Rubus woodland is the likely culmi-nation of such succession on the kind of soils where the Urtica-Cirsium community occurs. Distribution "
