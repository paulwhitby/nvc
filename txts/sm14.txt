"sm14","Zonation and succession Where Halimionetum occurs within the marsh zonation, its position is variable. It can be either above or below the Puccinellietum maritimae and boundaries between the two associations can be marked by mosaics (see Coril-lion 1953). At some sites, Halimionetum may run right from the upper limit of the pioneer zone to the sea wall. Where it does extend far down the marsh there is some-times an open mosaic of H portulacoides and Arthrocne-mumperenne at its lower limit. The association can occur on creek levees whether or not there is a nearby inter-creek zone of Halimionetum. Where it occurs in both situations on the same marsh, the creek Halimionetum may be above or below the inter-creek zone. Usually the creek Halimionetum cuts across the boundaries of a number of marsh communities. On the high marsh, Halimionetum in both situationsmay give way to a zone of Atriplici-Elymetumpycnanthi, sometimes with an intervening but patchy zone of Artemisietum maritimae. This zonation may indicate a successional sequence consequent upon sediment accre-tion. The origin and successional status of the Puccinellia maritima sub-community is obscure. Its distinctivephysiognomy may arise by invasion of the H. portula-coides-dominaiQd sub-community by P. maritima when the canopy opens with ageing of the bushes or as a result of grazing or by invasion of Puccinellietum by H portu-lacoides. Alternatively the co-dominants may simultane-ously invade some other salt-marsh community. Only long-term observation can elucidate the process(es)involved here. Other changes can occur within Halimionetum as a result of frost or human disturbance (Beeftink 1911 a, b; Beeftink et al. 1978). Killing of H portulacoides on creek levees by frost can result in the temporary replacement of the association by Artemisietum maritimae for 4-5 years. Disturbance in inter-creek basins produces a phase characterised by Suaeda maritima and Aster tripo-lium. Distribution "
