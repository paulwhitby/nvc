"ov20","Zonation and succession The Sagino-Bryetum often occurs isolated from other vegetation types in urban streets and yards. Among care-fully kept stonework, only the Parietaria and Cymba-laria communities or Asplenium vegetation among wall cracks may accompany it to bring some touch of green to the built environment. With less assiduous street maintenance, the Poa-Taraxacum community is also often present down pavement edges and gross neglect brings other Polygonion and Lolio-Plantaginion assem-blages, as well as tall-herb weed communities. Among urban ruins, for example, or ancient monuments where there is still some trampling, the Sagino-Bryetum often gives way to the Poa-Plantago and Polygonum-Chamomilla communities in places where crevices are https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.089 Published online by Cambridge University PressOV20 Sagino-Bryetum argentii community 393 larger and soil accumulation more extensive. On resown areas, the Lolium-Dactylis community can also figure. Some of this patterning represents successional develop-ments from the Sagino-Bryetum to more complex herba-ceous vegetation, though it is only the Lolium-Chamomilla sub-community of larger crevices that is readily colonised by bigger herbs. The Typical sub-community, in its very narrow cracks, is more resistant to such invasion, though trees and shrubs may colonise directly and prise open cobbles and paving as their roots grow. Sambucus nigra,Acer pseudoplatanus and the garden escape Buddleja davidii are commonly seen in such situations. Distribution "
