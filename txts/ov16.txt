"ov16","Zonation and succession Other weed assemblages of light, calcareous soils in south-east England where arable crops have not been too heavily fertilised or sprayed with herbicides include the Kickxietum spuriae and richer types of Stellar ia-Cap sella vegetation. Where soils are less base-rich, the Papaveri-Sileneetum tends to be replaced by the Papaveretum argemones and the Urtica-Lamium community. With increased intensification of arable agriculture, the Papaveri-Sileneetum gives way to the Veronico-Lamietum or Matricaria-Stellaria commu-nity or more species-poor forms of Stellaria-Cap sella vegetation. Repeated ploughing for arable crops prevents any prospect of succession. Distribution "
