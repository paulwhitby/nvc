"cg5","Zonation and succession As with other lowland calcicolous grasslands, stands of the community are now very much restricted to slopes or abandoned quarries isolated within landscapes devoted largely to arable farming. On such sites, zonations are usually a reflection of serai progressions related to the intensity of grazing and/or burning. Over scarp slopes, the community occurs in patchworks with Festuca- Avenula grassland (usually of restricted occurrence over the Oolite), other rank swards dominated by B. erectus or B. pinnatum alone, scrub and woodland. In old quarries, zonations may involve more open weed vege tation on young or recently-disturbed spoil and rock faces. The details of serai changes involving this vegetation type have never been studied. It seems likely that, in quarries, the Hieracium sub-community could progress to the Typical sub-community with colonisation of exposed surfaces and that either sub-community, perhaps especially the more open Hieracium vegetation, is prone to invasion by shrubs and trees. Continued burning and grazing can, however, maintain the community as a plagioclimax and some of the more extensive stands occur on commons where public demands and/or ownership by conservation agencies provide incentives to their continued maintenance as open spaces.
