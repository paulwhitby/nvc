"m3","Zonation and succession The Eriophorum angustifolium community characteristically forms a minor component in the mosaics of vegetation on intact or modified surfaces of Erico- Sphagnion mires or Ericion tetralicis wet heaths. It may represent a serai stage in the redevelopment of active mire vegetation following disruption. Exceptionally, the community can replace the Sphag- wwm-dominated bog pools in the wetter hollows of patterned Erico-Sphagnion mires, grading, with an increase in the Sphagnum carpet and an appearance of https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.007 Published online by Cambridge University PressM3 Eriophorum angustifolium bog pool community 57 vascular associates, to flat and hummock vegetation. Much more commonly, it forms well-delineated stands on expanses of bare peat which may or may not be flooded, passing to unvegetated ground or open water or, rather sharply, to the mire or wet heath context around. Where it occurs on eroded blanket mire, for example, it occupies part or all of stretches of the flatter gullies between the haggs, giving way to the bare hagg sides or degraded vegetation of eroded peat surfaces. In shallow peat cuttings, the stands often conform to the sharp geometric shapes of the excavations, passing abruptly to the unaltered mire vegetation on the uncut surface around or to its degraded derivatives on drained and much-modified deposits. The occurrence of scattered patches of Sphagnum papillosum and tussocks of Eriophorum vaginatum in some stands suggests that the Eriophorum angustifolium community may sometimes be a precursor to renewed establishment of Erico-Sphagnion mire but such successions have not been followed.Distribution "
