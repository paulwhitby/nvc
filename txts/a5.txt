"a5","Zonation and succession In shaded stretches of sluggish, eutrophic waters in the British lowlands, the Ceratophylletum demersi can dominate to the virtual exclusion of other kinds of aquatic vegetation, especially by mid- to late summer. In many tree-lined drainage ditches, for example, and in slow-moving streams receiving run-off from intensive agricultural land, the more species-poor sub-community may just be associated with stands of Elodea and a surface mat of the Lemnetum minoris or Lemnetum gibbae where conditions are not so shady. The Potamogeton pectinatus community can also figure in these simpler zonations, particular where the waters are strongly enriched or polluted. More varied sequences or mosaics involving the Ceratophylletum demersi are seen in clean and well-lit, standing or sluggish waters. Here, in pools, ditches and streams in the lowlands, it can occur, often as the richer Ranunculus sub-community, beneath Spirodela-Hydro charis mats or, in a few localities in Broadland, among the Hydrocharis-Stratiotes vegetation. Floating-leaved Nuphar lutea stands can also occur, particularly where the Ceratophylletum extends into deeper, slow-moving waters. Then, among the submerged aquatic element, the community may pass to the Potamogeton-M. spicatum vegetation, typically yielding to this assemblage, or to festoons of Callitriche stagnalis, in more quickmoving streams. Associated swamps are varied, but more mesophytic emergents such as Phragmites, Typha latifolia, Glyceria maxima and Sparganium erectum are the usual dominants around open waters with the Ceratophylletum, and fragments of the community may persist for some time as these thicken up during terrestrialisation of silting ditches and pools.
