"ov36","Zonation and succession The stands of the Ly thrum-Juncus community are char-acteristically clearly marked off from their intensively arable context. By August, as Preston & Whitehouse(1986) vividly describe the sight, they are picked out as pink islands, coloured by the flowers of Polygonumpersi-caria, among the golden ripening cereals.
