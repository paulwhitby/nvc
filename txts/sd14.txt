"sd14","Zonation and succession The Salix-Campylium community typically occupies slacks of moderate wetness in systems with a range ofground-water conditions, generally between ridges with various Festuca-Galium or Ammophila-Festuca swards. It is probably maintained by continuing winter flooding but any tendency to drying is marked by eventual pro-gression to woodland. Within individual slacks, depressions of natural or artificial origin where the moss carpet is opened up, can have local stands of the Bryum-Aneura sub-community among other kinds of Salix-Campylium vegetation. Drier stands can pass to the Salix-Holcus community ordirectly to Festuca-Galium swards on the dune-ridges around, a generally sharp shift with the change in ground moisture conditions. Successional change within the community sees the Bryum-Aneura type giving way to other sub-communi-ties and, in this process, the development of a tussock habit in Equisetum variegatum may play a distinctive part in the two or three decades it can take for Salix repens to form a dominant canopy (Hope-Simpson & Yemm 1979). As tussocks grow and fuse, creeping and stoloniferous species infilling any remaining spaces, itseems that the surface of the vegetation mat elevates perhaps several decimetres (Jones 1992).
