"mc1","Zonation and succession Seawards, the Crithmo-Spergularietum overlaps with and grades into the grey xeric-supralittoral lichen zone,generally occupied by the Ramalinetum scopularis (DR 1925) Klem. 1955 (Fletcher 1973a, b; James et al 1977). Above, there is usually an abrupt transition to the Festuca-Armeria maritime grassland on deeper, moister soils in less maritime conditions. In some cases, the zonation occurs gradually over progressively deeper and less saline soils through the Crithmum sub-community of the grassland. Where excessively-drained soils occurabove the most maritime zone on cliffs, the Crithmo-Spergularietum gives way to the Armeria-Cerastium community. On sea-walls, the association may be replaced by crevice vegetation which has a mixture of maritime andinland mural species like the Cymbalarietum. There is no evidence of any successional progression from Crithmo-Spergularietum. Distribution "
