"ov10","Zonation and succession In arable fields, the Poa-Senecio community can occur patchily within or around the crop, alone or with other Polygono-Chenopodion assemblages typical of cereals,roots or vegetables, the Polygonum-Matricaria or, mostly in the south-east, the Polygonum-Ranunculus sub-community being the typical forms here. In weedy leys or pastures, the Agrostis-Rumex sub-community often occurs among some Lolio-Plantagin-ion sward like the Lolio-Plantaginetum, sometimes with patches of Urtica-Cirsium vegetation. In very badly poached areas, these may give way to some sort of Bidention assemblage like the Polygonium-Poa commu-nity. Around drier gateways, there is often a sequence of Poly gonum-Chamomilla and Poa-Plantago assemblages. On slighter more acidic and less eutrophic soils, the Dactylis-Agrostis sub-community replaced the Agrostis-Rumex type. This sort of Poa-Senecio vegetation can also be seen with Lolium-DactyUs grassland on dis-turbed waysides and verges. Both P annua (Hutchinson & Seymour 1982) and S. vulgaris (Salisbury 1964) are able to complete their life cycle very quickly and, where conditions do not remaincongenial, this community can have but a fleeting exis-tence. In arable fields or seasonally-poached leys, it may return year after year but, where swards close, it is typi-cally replaced by some form of Lolio-Plantaginion vege-tation like the Lolium-Dacty Us community. This in turn may pass to the Arrhenatheretum. Distribution "
