"m4","Zonation and succession The community is typically found within or alongside Erico-Sphagnion mires, such as the Erica-Sphagnum papillosum raised or basin mire, or Ericion wet heaths, notably the Scirpus-Erica wet heath, either alone in fairly well-defined bog pools and soakways or in more complex mosaics with other poor-fen communities in more extensive soligenous areas. Most often, it marks out the wettest areas in the latter where water movement is quite diffuse, commonly passing to a fringe or watertrack of the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire on shallower and firmer peats where the throughput is more pronounced. In some places, Littorelletea communities occur alongside the Carex rostrata-Sphagnum recurvum mire in such complexes. The place of the community in terrestrialising successions is obscure. As with the Rhynchosporion bog pools, this kind of vegetation may be very stable provided the high water-table and modest irrigation are maintained. The most common changes encountered now are probably those caused by drainage which produces a demise of the more aquatic Sphagna and perhaps a transition to the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire with, where there is grazing, a spread of Juncus dominance.
