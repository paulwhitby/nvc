"s7","Zonation and succession Around more extensive open-water transitions, the community may form swamp which passes gradually to fen in which C. acutiformis remains a prominent component, e.g. some forms of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum, and it was from such situations that Lambert (1951) described her C. acutiformis sere along the Bure valley in Norfolk. At more abrupt water margins, the community occurs in often narrow and fragmentary transitions with the Sparganietum erecti towards deeper and, to land ward, the Glycerietum maximae or Phragmitetum aus tralis. Unlike the Caricetum ripariae, this community may also form swampy patches in calcareous floodmeadows and flood-pastures, passing gradually through some form of Calthion community to damp mesotro- phic grassland, but, with agricultural improvement, such transitions are becoming more rare. C. acutiformis seems to be quite an aggressive species which may be able to readily invade riverside fields where drains become blocked. It also appears to be able to tolerate cattle grazing (Wheeler 1975). Distribution "
