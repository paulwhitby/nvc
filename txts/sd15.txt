"sd15","Zonation and succession The Salix-Calliergon community typically occupies older and wetter slacks among stabilised dune systems, quite commonly with other types of slack vegetation in younger and drier hollows disposed according to the age of the dune ridges and the variation in the water-table(Figure 16). Transitions to surrounding dune grasslands depend on the configuration of the slacks and ridges. The high water-table and extensive moss carpet of thisvegetation inhibit colonisation by shrubs and trees but, in drier conditions, grazing by stock and rabbits may also be important in setting back succession. Where there is variation in hydrological conditions within individual large slacks, different types of Salix-Calliergon vegetation can be found in close proximity, grading the one into the other. Sometimes, too, where conditions become somewhat drier, this kind of slack assemblage can grade through the Equisetum sub-com-munity to the Carex flacca sub-community of the Poten-til la-Carex slack. In the opposite direction, where slacks contain stretches of permanent open water, the Holcus-Angelicasub-community can pass to some kind of Phragmites-Eupatorium fen, Phragmites swamp or the Eleocharit-etum palustris, more particularly the Littorella sub-community. The Salix-Calliergon community seems characteristic of late stages in succession (van der Laan 1979): at Kenfig Jones (1992) noted that stands appeared to have taken many years to develop and had not changed noticeably in 8 years. Where the ground continues to be flooded for considerable periods, it seems likely that this kind of veg-etation might have some stability. However, where woody plants do get a hold, it is generally Salix cinerea, S. caprea and Betula pubescens that colonise first, giving rise to some type of Salix-Betula-Phragmites or Salix-Galium woodland. In some sites, patches of these can be seen among stands of Salix-Calliergon vegetation. Distribution "
