"mg11","Zonation and succession Zonations involving the community most frequently reflect patterns of soil moisture and, on salt-marshes, the frequency of inundation of salt-laden water. Inland stands of the Lolium sub-community are frequently rather uniform but, where this vegetation occurs patchily in less well-managed grasslands, it grades, on drier ground, to some form of pasture, such as the Lolio-Cynosuretum or the Lolium-Alopecurus-Festuca community, and, around open water, to the Agrostis stolonifera-Alopecurus geniculatus grassland or to more open inundation communities. Salt-marsh stands of the Lolium sub-community and the Atriplex sub-community often pass down-marsh to some form of the Juncus maritimus community or Juncetum gerardi (such as the Leontodon sub-community or its derivatives). Secondary successions to the latter can sometimes be seen in turf-cuttings in the upper marsh which may be quickly colonised by P. anserina and have temporary stands of the Festuca-Agrostis- Potentilla community. Up-marsh, zonations are fre quently terminated artificially by a sea-wall or bank but the community sometimes grades to a less frequently inundated form of pasture, free of halophytes. Similarly, the Honkenya sub-community may form a transition zone between more unstable and halophytic strandline or shingle vegetation and essentially inland grassland. Festuca arundinacea is a sometimes conspicuous occasional in the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla community and probably increases its cover with a relaxation of grazing. Zonations between this community and the Potentillo- Festucetum arundinaceae may therefore be a reflection of successions between these two vegetation types mediated by changes in pasturing intensity.
