"m27","Zonation and succession The community can be found in a wide variety of zonations and mosaics with swamps, other kinds of mire, tail-herb vegetation and grasslands, among which the major lines of floristic variation are governed by interactions between soil moisture and trophic state and by differences in treatment. Scrub and woodland also often occur in close association with the Filipendula- Angelica mire and can undoubtedly develop from it, though, in many cases, this kind of vegetation seems somewhat resistant to the invasion of woody plants and able to persist in a fairly stable state, provided edaphic conditions and treatment remain unchanged. In the more natural vegetation sequences in which the Filipendula-Angelica mire is to be seen, it typically occupies a zone between standing or sluggish open waters on the one hand, and tail-herb communities on the other. Alongside small streams, as seen at Black Beck in the Esthwaite fens (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939) and at Malham (Proctor 1974), it can actually run right down to the water ’s edge, forming a strip over the intermittently flooded ground and often helping to accumulate small levees. In other cases, it can give way below to emergent vegetation on the permanently sub merged ground or that subject to extensive winter flooding. To the north of Britain, where the Valeriana- Rumex sub-community is a common component of open-water transitions around lakes and along streams, it is the Caricetum rostratae which often replaces it on wetter ground or, more locally, the Caricetum vesicariae, and, with these vegetation types, there can be a measure of floristic continuity, some of the associates of the Filipendula-Angelica mire extending out under the dominant sedge (Spence 1964, Proctor 1974, Adam et al. 1975). Such swamps also extend into western Britain and can be found abutting on to the Juncus-Holcus sub community where this occurs around open waters. To the south and east, by contrast, where the Urtica- Vicia sub-community is typical, it is the Phragmitetum australis that most often replaces it on wetter ground or, more occasionally, the Caricetum paniculatae or communities like the Sparganietum erecti or Typhetum latifoliae\ and, again, there can be some gradations between the vege tation types. Along stream sides and drainage ditches and around small pools and ponds which are maintained in an open condition, particularly common habitats for the Filipendula-Angelica mire to the south of Britain, zonations such as these can be very compressed, with little more than fragments of the various communities occurring in https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.031 Published online by Cambridge University Press296 Mires a belt of very small overall width. In more extensive open-water transitions, on the other hand, such as those found around some lakes in northern Britain and in Broadland, the ground between the swamps and the Filipendula-Angelica mire can be occupied by a wide zone of what is essentially Phragmitetalia fen, in which the tall helophytes and bulky sedges of the swamps retain their dominance but are accompanied by a richer suite of associates which shows considerable continuity with the meadowsweet vegetation. To the north of the country, such fen is typically of the Potentillo-Caricetum rostratae type; to the south and east, it can generally be grouped in the Phragmites-Eupatorium fen or, in Broadland the Peucedano-Phragmitetum, or very often now, around disturbed and eutrophicated water-margins, the Phragmites-Urtica fen. However, only where the substrates of the fen hinterland are maintained in a reasonably rich state, either by fresh deposition of silt in floods, or by input of nutrients from the landward edge, will they be able to sustain the Filipendula-Angelica mire in such extended zonations as these and, at some sites with large tracts of fen, the community is very much restricted to the edges of streams, soakways or dykes, running through, or cut through, the flood-plain deposits. Both kinds of pattern can be seen at Malham, where complex variations in water-depth and nutrient- and base-status across the fens result in particularly varied mosaics of rich and poor fens disposed over the peats between the channels and grading, with varying degrees of abruptness, to the Filipendula-Angelica mire on the richer, circumneutral deposits (Proctor 1974). Even in more extensive and natural zonations such as these, the sequence of vegetation types rarely continues on to drier ground without some suspicion of modification as a result of man ’s activities. Very locally in northern Britain, it is possible to see transitions from the Valeriana-Rumex sub-community to the Molinia-Crepis mire on ground that is subject to less marked fluctuations in water level, as at Malham (Proctor 1974), and, around flushes on the lower valley sides of some Pennine dales, such zonations can continue into stretches of Anthoxanthum-Geranium grassland, a community which is often cut for hay, but which is otherwise little improved (Jones 1984). Very commonly through northern and western Britain, however, even where the sur rounds of mires and flushes with the Filipendula-Angelica mire have escaped marked improvement, they are heavily grazed, so many stands of the Valeriana-Rumex and Juncus-Holcus sub-communities survive sharply marked off from surrounding Nardo-Galion swards by artificial boundaries, remaining largely within fenced- off damp hollows or field corners, and persisting otherwise only in very fragmentary fashion along stream sides running through pasture.The situation within southern and eastern England is very similar, except that there the agricultural landscape is more intensive and largely given over in certain areas to arable cropping with its attendant eutrophication of the drainage waters by fertiliser run-off. More natural zonations probably run from the Urtica-Vicia sub community to some kind of Arrhenatheretum, and there can be considerable overlap between the two vegetation types. Paradoxically, such transitions are now most easily seen within the artificial roadside verge habitat, where damp ditches and drier banks often carry these two closely juxtaposed. In many places, however, the Urtica-Vicia sub-community gives way, not to such grasslands, but to eutrophic tail-herb vegetation dominated by such plants as Urtica and Epilobium hirsutum, which forms a fringe on the disturbed and enriched edges of mires and drainage ditches, set within intensive pastoral or arable landscapes. Where more traditional regimes of mowing and graz ing have been extended down, around mires and flushes, on to the moister soils normally occupied by the Filipen dula-Angelica mire, further variations on these patterns can be seen. Detailed studies of the effects of such treatments on the community have never been undertaken, but it seems likely that grazing, and perhaps also regular summer-mowing, convert it to the kinds of vegetation, generally dominated by rushes, included in the Calthion to the east of Britain, and in the Juncion acutiflori to the west and north. Where the Urtica-Vicia sub-community occurs in spring-fens, for example, it can often be seen alongside the Juncus-Cirsium rushpasture in those areas where stock have access or which, in the past, were mown for litter. Similarly, to the west, a very common context for the Juncus-Holcus sub-community is stretches of the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture, which form a transitional zone between the Filipendula- Angelica mire and the surrounding Nardo-Galion sward where stock have had access to the damper flush sur rounds. With further cropping and selective nutrient de pletion, such developments could proceed further with the expansion of Molinia in Junco-Molinion swards. Even where such treatments have been withheld for long periods of time, progression of the Filipendula- Angelica mire to woodland seems slow, perhaps because of the overwhelming dominance of the meadowsweet, and, quite commonly, stands of the community can be found closely hemmed in by a cover of trees or shrubs. However, observation suggests that invasion of woody plants can take place and it seems likely to result in the development of either drier forms of the Salix-Betula- Phragmites woodland, particularly in the south and east, or, to the west and north, the Salix-Galium or Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodlands. Drying and dis turbance of the substrate probably favours progression to the Alnus-Urtica woodland. https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.031 Published online by Cambridge University PressM27 Filipendula ulmaria-Angelica sylvestris mire 297 Distribution "
