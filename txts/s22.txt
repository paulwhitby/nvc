"s22","Zonation and succession Sometimes, the three sub-communities occur as a zonation around the edges of deeper ponds. Often, however, small stands of the Glycerietum form a mosaic among other swamp communities on the more open margins of pools and streams. In wet pasture hollows, the Alopecurus sub-community may give way on drier ground to the Lolio-Cynosure turn and on coarser inundated sediments on river banks to Elymo-Rumicion vegetation. On the Ouse Washes the community occurs in mosaics with the Agrostis stolonifera-Alopecurus geniculatus inundation grassland in areas which are sheep- grazed in summer and subject to shallow winter flooding. https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.052 Published online by Cambridge University PressS22 Glycerietum fluitantis swamp 217 Distribution "
