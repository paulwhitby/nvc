"ov13","Zonation and succession The Stellaria-Capsella community replaces other weed assemblages on loamy soils as cultivation practices are intensified. Where stretches of crop are less effectively fertilised and sprayed, it can be found with the Papavere-tum argemones and, on more obviously calcareous soils in the warmer and drier south-east, by the Kickxietum spuriae. On more sandy and less base-rich soils in eastern Britain it can give way to the Urtica urens-Lamium community and, in the far south-west, to the Cerastium-Fumaria community. More widely, in inten-sive arable landscapes, the Stellaria-Capsella commu-nity is found with the Veronico-Lamietum, theAlopecurio-Chamomilletum and the Matricaria-Stel-laria community. Continued cultivation effectively prevents any succes-sion.Distribution "
