"mc6","Zonation and succession The Atriplici-Betetum usually represents the most mari-time vegetation where it occurs, replacing the Crithmo-Spergularietum or Armeria-Ligusticum community though it also occurs higher up cliffs in the zone normally occupied by the Festuca-Armeria maritime grassland(Figure 20). Fragments of each of these communities may occur in mosaics with the Atriplici-Betetum where the effect of sea-birds is not too severe and may be able toexpand if sites are abandoned by the birds. Very intense or prolonged activity may result in the total degeneration https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.061 Published online by Cambridge University Press282 Maritime cliff communities of the normal maritime vegetation (see Sobey 1976 on the Isle of May). Foreshore stands occur with other strandline vegetation like the Honkenya-Cakile and Matricaria-Galium communities. DistributionThe community occurs patchily around the cliffed coasts and foreshores of the south and west extending north into Scotland. Particularly fine examples are found in sites less subject to human disturbance of nesting sea-birds as on islands. The distribution of Lavatera arborea within the community is probably limited by climatic factors: Okusanya (1979c) has shown this species to be injured by low temperatures and destroyed by slight frosts (-5 °C). Affinities As described here, the community includes some of the vegetation noted in accounts of sea-bird colonies Figure 20. Vegetation of sea-bird cliffs at St Govan's Chapel, Stackpole. MCI Crithmo-Spergularietum vegetation occurs in crevices on the lower spray-splashed stretches of the cliffs at this site but is replaced by luxuriant stands of MC6 Atriplici-Betetum vegetation beneath ledges occupied by nesting guillemots and gulls. Higher up the cliffs, as the influence of spray becomes less intense, there are ledges with, first, the Crithmum sub-community of MC8 Festuca-Armeria vegetation, then the Holcus sub-community. Where sightseers trample the cliff-top sward, this is replaced by the Plantago coronopus sub-community. (Redrawn from Cooper 1987, by permission of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.)

In Britain there seems no justification for separating a Lavatera arborea com-munity from one more generally dominated by A. pros-trata and B. maritima (cf. Gehu & Gehu 1969). Gehu & Gehu (1969) placed relatively short-lived communities of organically-enriched maritime environments in a newalliance, the Honckenyo-Crambion maritimae, within the Elymetea pycnanthi.
