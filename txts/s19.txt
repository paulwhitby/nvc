"s19","Zonation and succession The community can occur as the distal component of swamp and fen zonations in open-water transitions. The Littorella sub-community is commonly found in such situations over sand and gravels around exposed shores in some Scottish lakes (Spence 1964). Here, it grades in deeper water to submerged vegetation with combinations of L. uniflora, Lobelia dortmanna and Juncus bulbosus. In other cases there is a front of the Scirpetum lacustris in deeper water. Inshore, this sub-community can give way to the Caricetum rostratae, the Caricetum vesicariae, the Phragmitetum australis or the Phafaride- tum arudinaceae (e.g. Pearsall 1918). In lowland open-water transitions with silty sub strates the Eleocharis sub-community can again lead the zonation giving way to aquatic vegetation with Potamogeton natans and duckweeds in deeper water or occur in shallow water mosaics with the Equisetetum fluviatile and the Sparganietum erecti. The Agrostis sub-community has been encountered as a dense fringe to streams running across the upper salt marsh in a few isolated localities in west Wales and around the Scottish coast (Adam 1976,1981). On Arran, it also occurs in flushes among coastal rocks and here E. palustris seems to replace E. uniglumis which is very rare https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.049 Published online by Cambridge University Press204 Swamps and tail-herb fens on the island but the usual Eleocharis sp. dominant in such northern situations (Adam et al. 1977).
