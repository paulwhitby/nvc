"sd16","Zonation and succession The Salix-Holcus community is a widespread type of slack vegetation occupying the older dry slacks in largeand complex dune systems and sometimes comprising the bulk of cover between stable dune ridges. Through the Agrostis and Poa sub-communities, it can grade to wetter slack vegetation in areas where the water-table breaches the surface in winter but often it occupies theentire area of individual slacks, the most obvious zona-tions being to the Festuca-Galium grassland on grazed dune ridges. With the shift to drier ground, the domi-nance of Salix repens declines and a mixture of grasses and smaller dicotyledons assumes dominance. Where the Prunella-Equisetum sub-community of the Salix-Holcus slack gives way to the Prunella type of Festuca-Holcus sward or the Ononis and Rubus sub-communities of the former pass to Typical Festuca-Holcus grassland, the shift can be quite gradual apart from the loss of Salix repens. Where grazing is less intensive, the Salix-Holcus slack can give way to Ammophila-Arrhenatherum grass-land.The Salix-Holcus community is a later stage in the development of slack vegetation, probably succeeding the Sagina-Bryum vegetation quite quickly where inun-dation ceases, replacing wetter slack communities more slowly as the surface dries. The lowering of the ground water table can play an obvious part in such a process but trapping of sand by S. repens and upbuilding of a mat upon which grasses can root may also be important. Where the canopy is a little more open, invasion of bushy Salix spp. and Betula pubescens can initiate the development of woodland. Where Hippophae occurs locally, it can supervene in such successions. Distribution "
