"a1","Zonation and succession The Lemnetum gibbae is typically found as floating mats adjacent to or among emergents of eutrophic and more shallow open waters. In the early stages of recovery after disturbance, it may be the only kind of truly aquatic vegetation, but it can occur with other duckweed com munities and, as succession resumes in the clearing waters, submerged plants can develop beneath it and floating or floating-leaved macrophytes among it, these latter able to replace it in time. With the increasing eutrophication and pollution of lowland water bodies, the Lemnetum gibbae may become a more extensive permanent feature. Very commonly around the fringes of ditches and ponds with fine mineral substrates, the community occurs among semi-submerged mats and emergent shoots of such water-margin vegetation as the Glycerietum fluitantis or other Glycerio-Sparganion assemblages dominated locally by plants like Nasturtium officinale, Apium nodiflorum, Berula erecta, Veronica beccabunga or Callitriche stagnalis, themselves well suited to the periodic instability of such habitats. In other cases, the Lemnetum gibbae can be found among emergent stands of the Sparganietum erecti, the Glycerietum maximae, the Typhetum latifoliae, the Phragmitetum or, in brackish ditches, the Scirpetum maritimae, and these may provide shelter for the duckweed mats out into deeper water. Where the water is standing or sluggish and relatively unaffected by wind, the Lemnetum can extend out as a surface mat beyond the zone of swamp vegetation and is sometimes the only kind of floating aquatic community. In other places, though, it can be found with the Lemnetum minoris, grading to it with a switch in dominance from L. gibba to L. minor, or with the richer Spirodela-Hydrocharis community, both of which it can probably replace. Where there has been regrowth of floating-leaved aquatics, the Lemnetum gibbae can occur as mosaics with the Potamogeton natans, Polygonum amphibium or Nuphar lutea communities, and as a mat over a variety of submerged aquatic vegetation, especially assemblages typical of more eutrophic or somewhat brackish waters, like the Ceratophylletum submersi, the Ceratophylletum demersi, the Elodea canadensis community and some of the fine-leaved Potamogeton communities. With regular disturbance and increasing enrichment, the Lemnetum gibbae may become repeatedly or more or less permanently established as part of a more impoverished suite of aquatic communities. Distribution "
"a10","Zonation and succession The Polygonum community occurs in its more permanent aquatic habitats with a variety of other free-floating and floating-leaved vegetation, and sometimes with an abundant submerged element. Emergents or water-margin plants often grow through stands in their colonisation of more shallow open waters and, provided the cover is not too densely shading, patches of P. amphibium can remain among these into quite advanced states of terrestrialisation. Periodically flooded ground with this kind of vegetation usually has mosaics or zonations with a variety of inundation communities. Sometimes, the Polygonum community is the only kind of floating-leaved vegetation in open waters, par ticularly where banks drop sharply to some depth or where there is marked fluctuation. Often, though, it occurs with stands of the Nymphaeetum or the Nuphar or Potamogeton natans communities and, where there is a gentle increase in depth, these can grow much further out than P. amphibium and may form an extensive zone beyond it. In other cases, small patches of all these vegetation types can occur in more intimate and frag mentary disposition, as in many small pools, and canals, or along the length of dykes and river margins. Stands of the Lemnetum minoris frequently persist among the Polygonum community, and these two types of vege tation may be among the first to return in any abundance after periodic spates. Stiller waters, particularly those that are somewhat more eutrophic, can have Elodea canadensis vegetation beneath the Polygonum community or sometimes the Potamogeton pectinatus-Myriophyllum spicatum vege tation, while around the margins of lakes towards the north and west there can be a sparse Littorella-Lobelia sward over the substrate. In these latter situations, the Polygonum community can be found as an element in vegetation patterns which do not seem to be subject to any but the slowest of successions (Spence 1964), and it can persist in more open stands of swamps like the Caricetum rostratae, the Caricetum vesicariae, the Equisetetum fluviatilis and the Scirpetum lacustris where these have colonised shal lower open water, and remain in patches in marginal Potentillo-Caricetum fen rafts. In the lowlands, and particularly in more mesotrophic water bodies with mineral substrates, serai processes can proceed much more quickly if the dykes or pools are not kept open. Here, the Polygonum community can be found beyond or within advancing emergent vegetation like the Glycerietum maximae, the Caricetum ripariae, the Typhetum angustifoliae, the Typhetum latifoliae and the Sparganietum erecti, eventually being shaded out in dense stands. It also often occurs around water margins with various types of Glycerio-Sparganion vegetation and this kind of association is characteristic, too, of some periodically wet habitats like flood-plain pools or seasonally wet lowland streams. At the limit of gleying around such places, there can be a zone of the Phalaridetum. Particularly distinctive of situations that are inundated from time to time are patchworks of the Polygonum community, occupying the wettest areas, with various kinds of Bidention vegetation disposed over moist silts and sands around, species such as Bidens tripartita, Polygonum lapathifolium, P. mite and P. hydropiper often assuming local dominance in virtually pure stands of one or other species. These in turn can be surrounded by a zone of Elymo-Rumicion vegetation, like the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla community which can grade in virtually continuous fashion to unflooded pasture on higher ground. Distribution "
"a11","Zonation and succession The Potamogeton-M. spicatum community is found alone, or with other submerged aquatic vegetation, extending to the limits of colonisation in less turbulent, base-rich waters, thinning out in more exposed situations and being replaced by other communities where conditions become less calcareous and eutrophic. Open covers of floating or floating-leaved aquatics can be found on the surface above the community and in shallower waters there can be invasion by swamp vegetation. Through the lowlands of southern and eastern Bri tain, the P. pusillus and Elodea sub-communities can be found in less polluted, sluggish waters grading to locally dense stands of Elodea vegetation in which associate species are very few and sparse, or in shaded situations to luxuriant patches of the Ceratophylletum demersi. Very commonly, too, especially with the Elodea sub community, there is an associated floating mat of the Lemnetum minoris or sometimes an open cover of the Polygonum amphibium, Potamogeton natans or Nuphar lutea floating-leaved vegetation. The most frequently associated swamps of open-water transitions from such aquatic assemblages are the Sparganietum erecti, the Typhetum latifoliae, the Phragmitetum and the Glycerietum maximae, with the Caricetum ripariae and Scirpetum lacustris more occasionally represented. Around the shelving water margins of small pools, dykes and canals and along the banks of streams, various kinds of Gly-cerio-Sparganion vegetation can also be found trailing out into the Potamogeton-M. spicatum community. Where there is an increase in turbulence in such waters, shifting into wave-disturbed zones or into more fast-moving or spatey streams, the P. pusillus and Elodea sub-communities become increasingly sparse in cover, and impoverished in their species content, such that just scattered, puny plants of P. pectinatus and M. spicatum finally remain. Further upstream in base-rich moving waters, these kinds of vegetation can be replaced by the Ranunculetum fluitantis, the Ranunculus penicillatus community or Callitriche stands. Patterns involving the P. filiformis sub-community in its distinctive north-west Scottish sites are of a rather different character, particularly where there is some influence within the same loch or pool of peaty, base poor waters, quite a common and very striking feature over parts of the machair. Here, such submerged vege tation as the Elodea communities and the Ceratophylletum demersi are rarely present, although where there is some saline influence, the Potamogeton-M . spicatum vegetation may give way to the Ruppietum maritimae in which such species as P. pectinatus, Ranunculus baudotii, Hippuris vulgaris and Zannichellia palustris maintain some representation. More often, with the decreasing influence of shell-sand, there is a fall in pH and conductivity of the waters and the community is replaced by the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum vegetation. The P. filiformis sub-community can be seen as transitional to this assemblage and, indeed, P. pectinatus, P. filiformis, P. pusillus and P. natans can run on into it at moderately high frequency and with some local abundance. Typically, though, it is P. perfoliatus and P. gramineus which provide the most consistent element of the less calcico-lous vegetation, together with M. alterniflorum, which almost completely replaces M. spicatum. In some places, where peaty shallows pass quite suddenly to shelly beds further out, the switch from one vegetation type to the other is quite sharp, but often the influence of the different substrates is less well defined, when transitions can be extensive. There is often, too, some Littorella uniflora amongst both assemblages, which adds to the continuity of the pattern, and this can thicken up locally in zonations to the Littorella-Lobelia community, especially where the substrate becomes gravelly. A floating-leaved element may be represented by the Nymphaeetum albae or the Potamogeton natans community and the usual swamps associated with the margins of these waters are the Eleocharitetum palustris, the Equise-tetum fluviatilis, the Caricetum rostratae or, occasionally, the Phragmitetum. Such sites have, for the most part, been spared any marked influence of eutrophication or pollution but, elsewhere, the P. pusillus and Elodea sub-communities have often been replaced by impoverished P. pectinatus vegetation with increased richness and contamination of the waters. Distribution "
"a12","Zonation and succession In highly eutrophicated and polluted sites, this community may be the only kind of aquatic vegetation to survive but, in cleaner conditions, it can be found with various other submerged, floating and floating-leaved assemblages typical of richer waters. In more base-rich pools, dykes and streams, the P. pectinatus community can sometimes be clearly seen as an impoverished form of the Potamogeton-M. spicatum vegetation, developed where this particular species of pondweed has attained local luxuriance, and grading to the richer assemblage with an increase in the frequency and cover of M. spicatum, Elodea canadensis or E. nuttallii and other Potamogeton spp., such as P. perfoliatus, P. crispus, P. pusillus and P. lucens. The Elodea spp. may themselves thicken up patchily into species-poor stands, and there can also be stretches among these mixtures dominated by the Ceratophylletum demersi. The Polygonum amphibium community may also form a canopy of floating leaves in the shallower waters, with Nuphar lutea stands occurring further out in deeper pools, dykes and slow-moving waters. Mats of the Lemnetum gibbae and the Lemnetum minoris may occur in sheltered situations. A variety of emergents can invade the margins of such open waters, with communities like the Sparganietum erecti, the Typhetum latifoliae, the Phragmitetum and the Glycerietum maximae developing as a zone in the shallows or as clumps distributed along the edges of dykes and streams. These may persist around the fringes of eutrophicated and polluted waters, where the aquatic element is reduced to clumps of the P. pectinatus community and sparse Elodea vegetation and Ceratophylletum demersi. In brackish situations, the P. pectinatus community may again be the sole surviving vegetation where there has been some contamination of the waters but, in cleaner dykes and pools in, for example, coastal marshes, it can occur with the richer Potamogeton-M. spicatum assemblage and dense stands of the Ceratophylletum submersi. In this latter, P. pectinatus can maintain its constancy but it yields in abundance to plants such as Ceratophyllum submersi, Zannichellia palustris and Ranunculus baudotii. Floating mats of the Lemnetum minoris can also occur over such vegetation and there can be colonisation by the Scirpetum maritimi or Scirpetum tabernaemontani. Fragmentary patterns of the kind described for fresh waters will persist in quite swift flows, as in mill races, watercress bed feed-streams and the upper reaches of rivers and, in such situations, there is often some zonation to patches of the Callitriche stagnalis community or various kinds of crowfoot vegetation. There can also be some seasonal variation in the prominence of the different dominants too, with C. stagnalis and the Ranunculus spp. showing luxuriance in late spring and early sum mer, P. pectinatus reaching its peak of abundance later in the year, along with the Glycerio-Sparganion vege tation that frequently trails into the margins of such waters. In chalk streams, some of these marginal plants, like Apium nodiflorum and Nasturtium officinale, together with various crowfoot taxa, can penetrate to the higher reaches, while the Callitriche and P. pectinatus communities peter out at lower levels. Along waters draining sandstone rocks and shales, Callitriche vege tation can replace the P. pectinatus community with the shift to swifter flows upstream. Distribution "
"a13","Zonation and succession The Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum community is usually found with other kinds of aquatic vegetation in characteristic zonations of less base-rich and only moderately fertile waters, becoming attenuated with increasing turbulence and giving way to other assemblages where conditions become more calcareous or eutrophic. Colonisation by emergents around the margins of waters with the community is usually fairly slow and in some places succession to swamp may be very long delayed. Sometimes, around the sheltered shores of lakes in north-west Britain, the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum vegetation is the first community of submerged aquatics encountered in moving offshore, colonising fine to fairly coarse sediments deposited in depths of 50 cm or more and free of much turbulence. Very often, however, there is in the shallows inshore, and particularly where these have a coarse sandy or gravelly bed, a zone of Littorella-Lobelia vegetation. As well as Littorella, M. alterniflorum may run on into such swards in some abundance blurring the boundary but, apart from occasional P. perfoliatus, P. gramineus, P. pusillus and P. filiformis, pondweeds are scarce, whereas Lobelia dortmanna increases greatly in frequency and cover. In shallow or moderately deep waters, the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum community may continue and occupy most of the lake floor wherever suitable sediments occur, but quite commonly it is replaced below by a zone of Isoetes lacustris vegetation, as in the patterns described from Scottish lakes described by Spence (1964). Much more locally, usually in smaller and shallower waters, stands of the rare I. setacea can occur among the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum community. Then, such sequences quite frequently have dense stretches of Chara or Nitella spp. from which flowering plants are virtually absent, and these may extend both above and below the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum vegetation, as in the zonation shown by Pearsall (1918) from Fold Yeat Bay in Esthwaite. In other localities, luxuriant patches of the species-poor M. alterniflorum community can be found among the pondweed vege tation (Spence 1964) and it is sparse stands of this plant which generally replace the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum community in the faster or more spatey stretches of mesotrophic and more base-poor rivers through the upland fringes. In somewhat more fertile, standing or sluggish waters with the P. berchtoldii sub-community, vigorous stands of Elodea vegetation may also be seen and, if eutrophication of upland lakes increases, this might be expected to overwhelm richer pondweed as semblages of this kind. Particularly striking patterns are seen in those open waters in north-west Scotland where the P. filiformis sub-community occurs in the less calcareous shallows of some of the machair lochs, notably on South Uist, grading to the more basiphilous Potamogeton-M. spicatum vegetation where the influence of shell-sand pre vails. Species such as P. pectinatus, M. spicatum, Ranunculus baudotii and Hippuris represent a transition to the P. filiformis sub-community of that assemblage, and where the effect of the different substrates and waters is ill-defined, the stands of the different vegetation types may intergrade. As a rule, however, M. alterniflorum tends to be very sparsely represented in the Potamogeton-M. spicatum community, with P. gramineus usually only occasional. Both kinds of Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum vege tation can be found with a floating-leaf canopy of the Potamogeton natans community, with the Nyphaeetum albae often represented in deeper waters or, in somewhat more eutrophic situations, the Nuphar lutea community. The usual swamps associated with such aquatic assemblages are the Eleocharitetum, the Equisetetum, the Caricetum rostratae, the Scirpetum lacustris and the Pragmitetum, with usual but slow succession to the Potentillo-Caricetum or Caricetum vesicariae fen (Figure 6). Distribution "
"a14","Zonation and succession In both standing and moving waters, the Myriophylletum tends to occupy some of the more turbulent situations, giving way to other kinds of aquatic vegetation where conditions are stiller and substrates more fertile. It is replaced in dystrophic peaty waters by different submerged communities and is sometimes found with more basiphilous aquatic assemblages where there is local influence of lime-rich substrates and waters. In lakes with more acidic waters, the Myriophylletum can be found down to about 3 m depth where conditions are clear, and on moderately exposed shores it often passes in the gravelly or stony shallows to the Littorella-Lobelia community. M. alterniflorum usually remains very frequent in this vegetation, but Littorella uniflora and Lobelia dortmanna become constant and are generally of high cover. Then, in deeper water where there is a little less turbulence and more deposition of fine mineral material, the Myriophylletum gives way to the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum community. The two vegetation types intergrade, but there M. alterniflorum is typically accompanied by, not only L. uniflora, but also a variety of pondweeds, of which the commonest are Potamogeton perfoliatus, P. gramineus, P. pusillus, P. berchtoldii and P. obtusifolius, all of these more prone to battering than the milfoil. Dense stands of Chara or Nitella spp. also often occur. A clear zonation involving all these communities is shown in Pearsall's (1918) sketch of aquatics in Fold Yeat Bay in Esthwaite. The Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum vegetation can also be seen replacing the Myriophylletum in moving waters where the flow becomes a little slacker or less spate-prone in moving downstream, and the deposition of mineral material more extensive. Towards the upper reaches of such streams, the Myriophylletum can show extensive overlap with the Callitriche stagnalis community, and indeed this vegetation may replace it where vascular plants retain a patchy presence far up into the torrent-like heads of such river systems. In other places, the Myriophylletum represents the limit of such vege tation before bryophyte communities of submerged rocks dominate the aquatic environment. Another fairly frequent transition can be seen where quieter stretches of peaty waters interrupt or replace more fast-flowing rocky reaches with the shift to gentler, boggy terrain. Then, the Myriophylletum often gives way to Potamogeton-Ranunculus soakways, with P. polygonifolius, Ranunculus flammula, R. omiophyllus and Agrostis stolonifera. Pools along such trickling waters may also have Juncus bulbosus vegetation, but M. alterniflorum only rarely extends into such dystrophic assemblages. Distribution "
"a15","Zonation and succession The E. canadensis community can be found with a variety of other submerged aquatic vegetation in more nutrient-rich, standing or slow-moving waters, although where conditions are especially congenial it may over whelm these with its luxuriant growth. Open covers of floating-leaved or floating vegetation may occur above the pondweed, and the community can persist in sparse swamp but, where colonising emergents become dense, it is shaded out. In many lowland ponds, dykes and canals, stands of E. canadensis are a major element among the aquatics, sometimes the only submerged vegetation. Duckweed mats are often found in association, of the simpler kind with Lemna gibba or L. minor or, in purer waters, of the richer Spirodela-Hydrocharis type. In a very few places, as among some of the Broadland dykes, the E. canadensis community occurs in intimate association with Hydrocharis-Stratiotes vegetation. Stands can persist, too, beneath open canopies of the water-lily communities, the Nymphaeetum albae and, more commonly in richer waters, the Nuphar lutea vegetation, or under the Potamogeton natans or Polygonum amphibium communities, but wherever these become dense, E. canadensis tends to be shaded out. Quite often, in such situations, or beneath overhanging woody vegetation alongside dykes or streams or around pond margins, it is replaced by the more tolerant Ceratophylletum demersi. In other places, there is a more varied submerged aquatic flora in which stands of E. canadensis become locally dense among richer assemblages like the Potamogeton-M. spicatum community of cleaner, base-rich, eutrophic waters. However, comparing past and present accounts of aquatic vegetation, it seems certain that some of the spread of E. canadensis has been at the expense of such communities, their diversity in composition and dominance being reduced as a result. The same trend is visible to a lesser extent in the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum vegetation, though this is a community of more base-poor and less eutrophic waters, many of whose stands occur beyond the range of E. canadensis. Both these kinds of pondweed vegetation and related M. alterniflorum stands can also tolerate somewhat more fast-moving waters than the E. canadensis community and they persist, albeit often in attenuated forms, higher upstream than it can penetrate. The same is true of crowfoot vegetation dominated by Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans and R. flui tans, though these can be found in patchworks with E. canadensis in more slow-moving reaches of streams and rivers, the proportions of the vegetation types often varying from season to season and through any years (Butcher 1933). E. canadensis is sometimes found growing with its more recently introduced relative E. nuttallii, although great abundance of the one is rarely seen among vigorous plants of the other, and it is possible that there is some kind of competitive relationship between the two. Certainly, there are cases where E. nuttallii has been seen actually to replace E. canadensis over a few years (Briggs 1977, Lund 1979), although the basis of such changes is unclear (Simpson 1984). In polluted waters, neither of these pondweeds thrives and, in the many places where effluents have drained into open waters with the E. canadensis community it has been replaced by P. pectinatus vegetation where any vascular plants at all have survived. Many of the more fertile lowland waters favoured by E. canadensis are very prone to marginal invasion of swamp plants, and stands are sometimes found among open covers, the Scirpetum lacustris, the Typhetum latifoliae or Glycerio-Sparganion water-margin vegetation, but any more than light shade is inimical to the pondweed. Distribution "
"a16","Zonation and succession The C. stagnalis community occurs with a wide range of other submerged, floating-leaved and floating aquatic vegetation in diverse patterns in the different habitats in which it is found. In stiller, shallow waters, especially where these are more eutrophic, invasion by emergents is common and sometimes rapid, but C. stagnalis vege tation can persist long on periodically flooded ground among advancing swamps and even reappear in rain-filled pools where climax forest is opened up. In such habitats as dykes, canals and ponds, the community can be found among other more speciespoor assemblages of submerged aquatics like the Ceratophyllum demersi, the Elodea canadensis vegetation and stands of Potamogeton pectinatus, though it is usually more strictly confined than these to shallow waters, and it will not stand as much turbidity as the first, nor as much enrichment and pollution as the last. Cleaner and more base-rich waters, standing or with up to moderately fast flow, may also have the richer and more diverse Potamogeton-M. spicatum community, among which various Callitriche spp. can remain occasional and locally quite abundant. On the surface of these kinds of waters, the Callitriche stands can sometimes be seen in more open stretches of floating-leaved covers of the Nuphar lutea, the Potamogeton natans or the Polygonum amphibium communities and, where the waters are more sluggish or still, there are very often patches of the Lemnetum gibbae, the Lemnetum minoris or, more locally, the richer Spirodela-Hydrocharis vegetation. In Broadland dykes, stands of C. platycarpa occur in some abundance among the Hydrocharis-Stratiotes community. Where the muddy margins of such open waters are periodically exposed, C. stagnalis vegetation can persist for some considerable time on the moist ground, often with scattered thalli of the duckweeds, and sparse patches of such mixtures can survive long in the shade of invading emergents. Most commonly, around these stiller, eutrophic waters, it is communities like the Phragmitetum, the Glycerietum maximae, the Typhetum latifoliae and the Sparganietum erecti that colonise the transitions, with various kinds of Glycerio-Sparganion vegetation, patchily dominated by such plants as Nas turtium officinale, Apium nodiflorum, Veronica beccabunga and smaller Glyceria spp., along the disturbed edges of dykes and streams. It is this latter kind of vegetation that usually provides a marginal fringe to stands of the C. stagnalis community in the middle and upper reaches of its Chalk stream habitat. Where there is a perennial water flow, the starworts can be very prominent in a band up to 1 m wide along the edge of a stream, mixed in with floating shoots of the Glycerio-Sparganion herbs. Submerged clumps of the community can extend into the deeper waters of the stream centre, but their cover is usually of minor importance compared with the luxuriant crowfoot vegetation that typically dominates that zone. Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans is particularly important in such reaches, but R. aquatilis and R. peltatus also occur, and indeed it is these latter species which generally extend higher into the summer-dry reaches of the streams where, together with the C. stagnalis community, they form the bulk of the cover on the dampest ground of the bed (Haslam 1978). In the fast-flowing, acidic and impoverished waters of streams in the upland fringes, the vegetation patterns look very different. Here again, the C. stagnalis community becomes more obvious in the upper reaches, but its usual companions are assemblages like the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum vegetation or, in swifter streams, the Myriophyllum community. Glycerio-Sparganion vegetation can occur, often rather fragmentarily, along the banks or patches of the Sparganietum erecti or the Phalaridetum, or there can be just slumped slabs of the surrounding pasture, with more moisture tolerant herbs showing locally luxuriant growth. Where peaty waters drain in, or where there is a transition to bog soakways, the C. stagnalis community often passes to Potamogeton-Ranunculus vegetation in which starworts can retain an occasional presence, though in associated dystrophic pools, there is usually a sharp switch to Juncus bulbosus vegetation. In the swiftest reaches of mountain streams, the C. stagnalis community maintains only a sparse presence in slacker byways, and is finally replaced entirely by submerged moss-dominated vegetation. Distribution "
"a17","Zonation and succession R. penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans vegetation is sometimes found dominating whole stretches of streams and rivers to the virtual exclusion of other aquatics, but often it occurs with other assemblages of submerged and floating-leaved plants in patterns related to the speed of flow and trophic state of the waters. Zonations along and across Chalk streams are especially distinctive with seasonality of flow becoming important in the upper reaches. Where this kind of vegetation extends into slacker waters it shows some overlap in its occurrence with Elodea canadensis stands and the Ceratophylletum demersi, the former like the crowfoot tending to be most prominent in early summer, the latter becoming more abundant later in the season. There can also be considerable differences in the proportions of the communities from season to season (Butcher 1933). With increase in the trophic state of the waters and a shift to finer sediments, as happens in moving downstream, it is vegetation of this kind that eventually replaces the R. penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans, or there may be a switch to richer Potamogeton-M . spicatum vegetation, a pattern well seen with the move to clay substrates in the lower reaches of some Chalk streams. The Nuphar lutea community can also become prominent over crowfoot stands as such quieter, richer waters are reached. Callitriche stagnalis stands are common, too, in shal lower or sheltered places in these stretches but it is in the higher, faster reaches that this vegetation becomes really abundant in Chalk streams, forming a zone along the water margins either side of a central strip often dominated by R. penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans, but with locally prominent Ranunculetum aquatilis and Ranunculetum peltati. Patches of herbs like Berula erecta and Apium nodiflorum can be abundant among the sub merged crowfoots, particularly as these lose their vigour later in the season, and they often thicken up in shal lower margins, together with Nasturtium officinale, to form a semi-emergent band of Glycerio-Sparganion vegetation, with occasional clumps of Sparganietum erecti swamp. Higher still, where summer flow becomes sporadic or non-existent, R. pencillatus ssp. pseudofluitans tends to yield dominance in the central zone to the Ranunculetum aquatilis and Ranunculetum peltati with patches of Callitriche vegetation, and the Glycerio-Sparganion herbs may extend in irregular fashion over much of the stream bed. R. penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans is only rarely represented in the aquatic assemblages of more base-poor streams and rivers where Callitriche and Myriophyllum alterniflorum vegetation are the major elements in faster reaches, but ssp. penicillatus (Webster 1988) is locally found there, and further sampling is needed through western England and Wales to establish the character of its stands (Newbold & Palmer 1979, Holmes 1983). Distribution "
"a18","Zonation and succession The Ranunculetum fluitantis can sometimes monopolise the vegetated stretches in faster, stony-bedded rivers but it is often found in mosaics with other aquatic communities where there is variation in turbulence and depth of the waters and the character of the substrate, and gives way to other assemblages with a shift in these factors downstream and up. Where the flow becomes a little slacker and the bed finer, this kind of vegetation can be found with stands of Elodea canadensis and, where the waters are less base poor, the Potamogeton-M . spicatum community, and these may replace the Ranunculetum fluitantis where lower river catchments are dominated by shales or clays. In highly eutrophic steams, Potamogeton pectinatus stands can take over from the community. Floating leaved stands of Potamogeton natans or Polygonum amphibium may occur and in the shallows there can be a zone of Glycerio-Sparganion vegetation or patches of the Phalar ide turn. These often persist along the margins of moving waters upstream of the major Ranunculetum fluitantis stretches where the submerged vegetation tends to com prise mixtures of Callitriche stagnalis stands, sometimes with the Ranunculetum aquatilis or, in more base-poor streams, the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum or M. alterniflorum communities. Distribution "
"a19","Zonation and succession The Ranunculetum aquatilis can be found with various other kinds of submerged aquatic vegetation, and sometimes with floating-leaved communities, the mosaics and zonations being influenced by the depth and speed of the waters and the character of the substrates. To wards water margins, transitions to Glycerio-Sparganion vegetation or certain types of swamp are usual, and taller emergents eventually overwhelm the community where they are invading shallower waters. Often, how ever, turbulence or fluctuation of the waters, or disturbance of the margins, helps maintain the Ranunculetum aquatilis as a more or less permanent feature. In faster-moving shallows, the community may be the major element among the submerged vegetation of coarser sands and gravelly beds, or occur with patches of the Callitriche stagnalis vegetation. In more base-poor streams, such as are found through the upland fringes of the north and west, the Myriophyllum alterniflorum community can also figure, these two kinds of vege tation generally extending much further into the torrential and spatey reaches upstream. In deeper waters with stable, stony beds, the Ranunculetum aquatilis can give way to the Ranunculetum fluitantis, and this vegetation may replace it entirely in wider stretches of river downstream, where the substrate consists of consolidated pebbles and boulders. Slacker reaches, with some deposition of finer mineral material, can have stands of the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum community and floatingleaved Nuphar lutea or Potamogeton natans vegetation. Along the water margins, there are often fragments of Glycerio-Sparganion assemblages or Phalaridetum swamp. In more calcareous, swift-flowing waters, notably in Chalk streams, the Ranunculetum aquatilis is not usually so abundant as the Ranunculetum peltati (Haslam 1978), but both these vegetation types comprise an important element in the stream beds of the upper reaches, often mixed with Callitriche stagnalis stands, and generally bordered or interrupted by clumps of Glycerio-Sparganion communities. The ability of the two crowfoot assemblages to withstand the late-summer drying-up of these streams gives them an important competitive advantage against Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans, though this becomes increasingly important with the move downstream into reaches that have perennial flow. With the shift into the more eutrophic stretches of these streams, where there is often much clay amongst the substrate, and where vegetation like the Potamogeton-M. spicatum community can become important, these crowfoot communities generally disappear. In the shallows of sluggish and standing waters of quite high fertility, the Ranunculetum aquatilis can maintain a presence, though it sometimes assumes a frail, floating form and often makes but a small contribution among luxuriant stands of submerged vegetation like the Elodea canadensis, Ceratophyllum demersum and Potamogeton pectinatus communities. However, fluc tuation in such waters or disturbance of the margins can favour its persistence and, around the margins of such pools and dykes, it often occurs in patchy mosaics with Callitriche stagnalis vegetation, sparse duckweed mats, Glycerio-Sparganion herbs and Sparganietum erecti swamp. In these situations, succession is repeatedly set back, but where more slow-moving waters are prone to invasion by emergents, the Ranunculetum aquatilis is quickly shaded out in dense covers. Distribution "
"a2","Zonation and succession The Lemnetum minoris is most often seen as floating vegetation beyond or among the marginal swamps of still, mesotrophic to eutrophic open waters. It can be the only kind of aquatic community in the early stages of colonisation, but is frequently found with other floating or submerged macrophyte vegetation and can persist in surface mosaics and among encroaching emergents, even under the canopy of developing swampy woodland. In more disturbed habitats it can recover quickly when periods of sluggish flow recur, and it can take brief advantage of temporarily wet conditions in much curtailed successions. In polluted waters, where more sensitive aquatic vegetation does not succeed it, the Lemnetum minoris may become a more persistent feature. Fragmentary covers of this vegetation can develop after rain along rutted pathways and on trampled ground, and indeed more terrestrial stands of the Riccia-Ricciocarpus sub-community can be a rather striking feature of such habitats. In such situations, though, as in temporary water bodies of larger size, streams which have only intermittent periods of sluggish flow, and ditches which are regularly cleaned out, the Lemnetum minoris remains a sporadic or ephemeral vegetation type. Here, the zonation often comprises at most a patchy mat of duckweed among Glycerio-Sparganion water-margin communities, with clumps of species such as Glyceria fluitans, Nasturtium officinale, Apium nodif-lorum and Callitriche stagnalis, or more persistent patches of the Sparganietum erecti, Acoretum calami, Typhetum latifoliae, the Glycerietum maximae or Sagit-taria vegetation. In more permanent and undisturbed water bodies, the Lemnetum minoris can be found persisting among the emergent shoots of swamp communities like the Phrag-mitetum, the Glycerietum maximae, the Caricetum pani-culatae and the Caricetum acutiformis, advancing in active succession. And where conditions are more shel tered it can extend out to form an integral part of the aquatic assemblages they are replacing, the L. trisulca sub-community being sometimes found in depths of 2-3 m where the waters are clear. Other richer duckweed vegetation of the Spirodela-Hydrocharis community can occur with the Lemnetum minoris or it may be succeeded by the Hydrocharis-Stratiotes community, or floatingleaved vegetation with Potamogeton natans, Polygonum amphibium or Nymphaea alba. Beneath the duckweed mat, there can be stands of the Elodea canadensis community, the Ceratophyllum demersi, the Ceratophyllum submersi and various fine-leaved Potamogeton vegetation. Polluted waters may have a more permanent cover of Typical Lemnetum minoris, although in such conditions the community is often replaced by the Lemnetum gibbae. Distribution "
"a20","Zonation and succession The Ranunculetum peltati occurs with a variety of other communities of submerged, floating-leaved and floating aquatics, the vegetation patterns reflecting differences in depth and speed of the waters, and the character of the substrate. Around water margins, zonations to Gly-cerio-Sparganion herbs or some sorts of swamp are very common, and where colonisation by emergents is advancing, the Ranunculetum peltati is quickly over whelmed. In many cases, however, fluctuations of the waters or disturbance of the water's edge helps maintain it more permanently. In more fertile standing or sluggish waters, the Ranunculetum peltati is sometimes found as a fragile, free-floating plant of insignificant cover, but occasionally denser clumps occur among such submerged vegetation as the Elodea canadensis or Ceratophyllum demersum communities, with stands of Nuphar, Potamogeton natans or Polygonum amphibium, and patches of the Lemnetum minoris or richer Spirodela-Hydrocharis vegetation. In such situations, patches or strips of Glycerio-Sparganion herbs, such as Nasturtium officinale, Apium nodiflorum, Veronica beccabunga and smaller Glyceria spp., or emergents like Sparganium erectum and Typha latifolia, are found along the water margins and the Ranunculetum peltati can persist on moist ground among these where the herbage is kept low and open through trampling by stock, sometimes with Callitriche stagnalis stands. Patterns of this kind can persist in the shallower, slacker reaches of larger lowland rivers, provided these are not too fertile, but the community makes a more important contribution to the vegetation patterns of running waters where moderate fertility, base-richness and summer drying are combined in the upper stretches of Chalk streams. In such situations, the Ranunculetum peltati, sometimes with the Ranunculetum aquatilis, and often with Callitriche stagnalis vegetation, occupies the bulk of the stream bed, generally with small patches of Glycerio-Sparganion herbs included in the central zone, and thickening up marginally to form a bounding strip. These become especially prominent later in the growing season, as the crowfoot cover fades, and towards the very head of the streams they often occlude the crowfoot zone altogether. However, the tolerance of some desiccation by both the Ranunculetum peltati and the Ranunculetum aquatilis gives them an important competitive edge against the Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans community for most of the summer-dry reaches and, it is not until the flow remains permanent downstream, that this vegetation takes over from the Ranunculetum peltati as the major cover of the bed.In the quite fast-flowing waters of streams through the upland fringes, the Ranunculetum peltati is sometimes found as a minor element among the Myriophyllum alterniflorum and Callitriche stagnalis communities, but the Ranunculetum aquatilis seems to be more common in such habitats. Distribution "
"a21","Zonation and succession The Ranunculetum baudotii is usually found with a number of other communities of aquatics adapted to the brackish environment, often with transitions along drainage systems where there are shifts to more or less saline conditions. Distinctive kinds of swamp or wet grassland vegetation commonly occur in close association with the community and, where silting is progressive, emergents eventually shade out the crowfoot. Fre quently, however, the clearing or dredging of dykes, or disturbance by stock, helps maintain the Ranunculetum baudotii as a more or less permanent feature. Other assemblages occurring with the community in standing or sluggish waters of a brackish character, are the Ceratophylletum submersi and the Potamogeton pectinatus vegetation. In the former, R. baudotii can remain very frequent, but C. submersum becomes obviously dominant; in the latter, the P. pectinatus is usually overwhelmingly abundant, with R. baudotii rather scarce. Richer Potamogeton-M. spicatum vege tation can also be found, and all three of these associated communities often continue into fresher waters of dyke systems where the Ranunculetum baudotii becomes rare. There, too, other aquatics may increase in prominence, with stands of Elodea canadensis vegetation and the Ceratophylletum demersi frequently making a contribution. Floating mats of the Lemnetum minoris or the Lemnetum gibbae also become more abundant in these fresher conditions. Towards the opposite extreme, where the waters become more saline, the Ranunculetum baudotii is quite often replaced by the Ruppietum maritimae, where R. baudotii, Zannichellia and P. pectinatus can all remain fairly frequent, but where Ruppia maritima becomes dominant, or, locally in south-east England, R. spiralis. Such gradients can be seen in the seaward end of marsh Figure 7. Generalised zonation across a brackish ditch. MG 12 Potentillo-Festucetum grassland A6 Ceratophylletum submersi community S20 Scirpetum tabernaemontani swamp A2 1 Ranunculetum baudotii community MG 13 Alopecurus-Agrostis grassland MGI 1 Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla grassland dyke systems, where streams debouch on to salt marshes and, rather strikingly, at the head of some sea lochs on the north-west coast of Scotland. In this part of Britain, too, certain machair lochs with some maritime influence can provide a suitable habitat for the Ranunculetum baudotii, growing in and around the associated streams and the lake shallows. Hippuris is often prominent in such situations, too, and both this and R. baudotii continue to make a frequent contribution to the Potamogeton filiformis sub-community of the Potamogeton-M. spicatum vegetation that occurs on the shellsand beds of the shallower loch margins. In its characteristic marsh dyke habitat the margins of the brackish waters frequently have stands of the Scirpetum maritimi or the Scirpetum tabernaemontani, the Phragmitetum or, where banks shelve, the Agrostis-Alopecurus grassland, the shoots of which can trail out into the waters. Where emergents colonise densely, they may crowd out the Ranunculetum baudotii, but dyke clearance often repeatedly sets back any tendency to succession. Trampled dyke or pool margins may have fragmentary patches of the Ranunculetum and Agrostis-Alopecurus vegetation among clumps of the Potentillo-Festucetum and Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla grasslands (Figure 7). Distribution "
"a22","Zonation and succession The Littorella-Lobelia community is a common element in the very characteristic zonations that are found in less fertile stretches of standing waters, the proportions and dispositions of the various vegetation types reflecting differences in water depth, turbulence and the character of the substrates. In more exposed and oligotrophic situations, the community is a more or less permanent feature in successions that are held in check by the harsh environmental conditions but, where accumulation of silt or organic detritus is able to proceed, this kind of vegetation is replaced by other aquatic communities or swamp. Quite often, both sub-communities of the Littorella-Lobelia vegetation occur together, the Littorella type occupying more shallow or turbulent waters, the M. alterniflorum sub-community replacing it with increasing depth or shelter, moving away from the shore or shifting round to less exposed aspects. Where more or less stony substrates run on into even deeper water in upland lakes, where neither Littorella nor L. dortmanna can maintain a vigorous presence, the community often gives way to Isoetes vegetation, the quillworts assuming dominance and extending as sometimes pure swards to several metres depth beneath the lower limit of the Littorella-Lobelia community (Gay 1863, Pearsall 1921, Spence 1964). In lakes which are not quite so infertile, however, or where there are local areas of shelter and deposition of finer mineral material within the waters, the Littorella-Lobelia swards can give way to other communities of submerged aquatics able to take advantage of the enriched conditions (Figure 8). Where there are banks of silt along lee shores, for example, or in somewhat deeper waters beyond the wave-disturbed zone or where cur rents from incoming steams drop suspended, this kind of vegetation is often replaced by the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum community. There, both Littorella and M. alterniflorum remain very frequent, but dominance com monly passes to pondweeds such as Potamogeton perfoliatus, P. gramineus, P. berchtoldii, P. obtusifolius or P. pusillus. Dense stands of M. alterniflorum can punctuate such patterns, often where there is a slight local increase in turbulence over sandier substrates, and there can be floating-leaved Nymphaeetum albae and Potamogeton natans vegetation with the shift to more sheltered and deeper waters. The zonations described from Cumbrian lakes by Pearsall (1918, 1921) show such variations clearly. In more base-rich, calcareous waters, the Littorella-Lobelia community often maintains a presence in the more wave-torn shallows, giving way in analagous zonations to those described above to the Potamogeton-M. spicatum community, sometimes with P. pectinatus stands and floating-leaved Nuphar lutea vegetation. Increased eutrophication of lakes with these kinds of patterns has seen an increase in recent years in the amounts of Elodea canadensis and E. nuttallii among such assemblages. Towards the opposite extreme, where waters become more peaty and dystrophic, as where lakes occur among or receive drainage waters from stretches of blanket mire, a common feature in Shetland and along parts of the north-west Scottish seaboard, the Littorella-Lobelia community can give way in sheltered shallows to the Juncus bulbosus vegetation. Sometimes this can be found suspended over sparse Littorella-Lobelia swards in peat bound embayments with stony beds, but it is J. bulbosus and M. alterniflorum which provide the strongest continuity between the vegetation types, with species such as Potamogeton polygonifolius, Utricularia vulgaris and Sphagnum auriculatum becoming more abundant where there is a real shift in the character of the habitat (Spence 1964). In the striking machair lochs on South Uist and at a few localities on the nearby Scottish mainland, the Littorella-Lobelia community can be found in the same water bodies as both dystrophic vegetation of this kind and basiphilous pondweed assemblages on calcareous shell-sand (Ratcliffe 1977). Where exposure restricts the accumulation of silt or organic detritus, the extent of Littorella-Lobelia stands can remain unchanged for decades (Spence 1964), but more sheltered and shallow waters are always prone to invasion by emergents. Eleocharis palustris and, more locally, E. multicaulis seem especially common as col-https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.026 Published online by Cambridge University PressA22a Littorella-Lobelia community, Littorella sub community in exposed stony shallows A23 Isoetes lacustris community in deeper waters with stony bed A22b Littorella-Lobelia community, Myriophyllum sub-commùnity on coarse sand towards sheltered bay A22b Figure 8.

Carex rostrata and Equise-tum fluviatile occur widely, too, extending into deeper water and being especially likely to gain a hold where there is accumulation of peaty material. Then, the Littorella-Lobelia community can give way to stretches of the Caricetum rostratae or Equisetum swamps from denser stands of which the smaller herbs are quickly crowded out. Where more silty material builds up, the Phragmitetum may replace the Littorella-Lobelia swards (Pearsall 1918, 1921, Spence 1964). Distribution "
"a23","Zonation and succession The Isoetes community typically occurs at the limit of vascular plant colonisation on the stony beds of infertile lakes, petering out where light attenuation becomes limiting and giving way to other kinds of aquatic vegetation with changes in depth of the waters and the character of the substrates. In the generally barren conditions favoured by the quillworts, these swards can be a more or less permanent feature, but any tendency to silting or accumulation of organic detritus leads to their replacement by other communities. Very often, where there is a continuous stretch of sandy or gravelly substrates from the shallows to deeper parts of oligotrophic waters, stands of Isoetes replace the Littorella-Lobelia vegetation in moving away from the shore. Transitions between the communities can be gradual, scattered rosettes of the quillworts making an occasional appearance in the Myriophyllum type of Littorella-Lobelia sward characteristic of deeper, stiller waters. Littorella and Lobelia can also extend some way, as a usually sparse cover, into the upper edges of the Isoetes stands, with M. alterniflorum and J. bulbosus remaining locally prominent too. The absolute depth of the switch from one vegetation type to the other varies somewhat with the amount of turbulence and the pat terns are quite often complicated where there is any tendency to deposition of finer mineral material in the less turbulent waters below the more wave-disturbed area along the shore. Where this occurs, with banks of sand being laid down among stretches of gravel and boulders, stands of the Utricularia sub-community of Juncus bulbosus vegetation can occur among the Isoetes swards of moderately deep waters. Then, where richer silts accumulate in such places, there can be transitions to the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum community (Figure 8). Boundaries tend to be quite sharp in these situations, but scattered quillworts can remain among the pondweed stands, and Littorella and M. alterniflorum are constant there, the latter often with high cover. Generally, though, Potamogeton spp. become much more prominent, with P. perfoliatus, P. gramineus, P. berchtoldii, P. obtusifolius and, in shallower waters, P. pusillus showing patchy abundance. Some kinds of floating-leaved aquatics can also root in these silted areas, notably P. natans and, more locally, Nymphaea alba, their foliage sometimes trailing out to form an open canopy over Isoetes stands in deeper water. Various patterns of these kinds can be seen in the vegetation maps from Cumbrian lakes in Pearsall (1918, 1921) and in the zonation diagrams of Spence (1964) from Scottish sites. Greater diversity than this among aquatic assemblages in the same waters as Isoetes vegetation is generally limited to those lakes where there are sharp con trasts in shelter and substrates, as on opposed shores or where there is deposition around input streams, and even then there is limited contact between the quillwort stands and the more mesophytic communities. In more stable lake systems, the boundaries betwen the vege tation may remain fixed for very considerable periods of time but, if silting should transgress on to Isoetes vegetation, the quillwort plants are quickly over whelmed because they cannot adjust their rooting level (Pearsall 1921). Then, with increased competition from other colonisers, the swards may be replaced by something like the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum. Even where substrates are less barren, much Isoetes vegetation occurs in waters too deep for direct invasion by emergents. In some places, however, the Scirpetum lacustris can be found sparsely represented among quillwort stands at moderate depth (Spence 1964) and, in stony shallows, transitions to Littorella-Lobelia vege tation may be locally complicated by the occurrence of the Eleocharitetum palustris. Where there is a shift to more peaty substrates in moderately deep waters, the Caricetum rostratae or Equisetetum fluviatile can be found inshore from Isoetes stands. Distribution "
"a24","Zonation and succession The Juncus community occurs with other kinds of submerged and floating-leaved aquatic vegetation in lakes and with bog pool and soakway assemblages on mifes. Emergents are sometimes found in association with the community but, in such infertile systems, these do not generally indicate any progression to swamp. Very often, the Utricularia sub-community occurs among the zonations from Littorella-Lobelia vegetation to Isoetes swards in moderately shallow water, where there is no turbulence and some deposition of slightly finer and less impoverished sand among the gravel and boulders. Such banks are sometimes seen a little way offshore, just beyond the wave-torn zone, or near the mouths of input streams (Pearsall 1921) and are usually well marked by the increase in the abundance of J. bulbosus, sometimes with M. alterniflorum, and the greater prominence of Utricularia and Sparganium spp., the small rosette plants of the Littorelletalia vegetation being largely overwhelmed by the deposited mineral material. Patches of finer and more fertile silt in these base-poor waters usually see a shift to the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum community and, though J. bulbosus, Utricularia and Sparganium spp. can remain occasional there, dominance is generally shared between M. alterniflorum and various Potamogeton spp. which figure only infrequently in the Juncus community (Pearsall 1921, Spence 1964). Quite commonly, in these sequences, the associated Potamogeton natans in the Juncus stands thickens up to form covers of floating-leaved vegetation, and there may also be patches of the Nymphaeetum albae. Sparse Scirpetum lacustris is also frequently found growing up through the Utricularia sub-community: indeed, Spence (1964) found this swamp to be a good indicator of the presence of the aquatic vegetation beneath in a number of Scottish lakes. The Sphagnum sub-community can sometimes be found in zonations in lake shallows, replacing the Utricularia type where the waters are sheltered and the substrates peaty. Then, there can be transitions to Potamogeton-Ranunculus soakway vegetation where https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.028 Published online by Cambridge University Press106 Aquatic communities waters trickle in from adjacent stretches of mire. Often, however, the Sphagnum sub-community occurs in small bog pools, where it may be the only aquatic vegetation apart from Sphagnum auriculatum stands, these generally overwhelmingly dominated by the moss, with just occasional J. bulbosus and Utricularia spp. and species like Menyanthes trifoliata and Eriophorum angustifolium appearing frequently. Carex rostrata is usually the com monest emergent in such waters and it may thicken up its cover locally among Juncus bulbosus vegetation. Distribution "
"a3","Zonation and succession The community is usually found on smaller, sheltered stretches of open water fringed by but a short or patchy cover of emergents. Other kinds of submerged aquatic vegetation can occur beneath it, and it may persist in fragmentary form among assemblages of floatingleaved macrophytes, but it is readily shaded out by them, and by encroaching swamp communities, relying on repeated cleaning for its continuing survival. Herbicide treatment or pollution, with increased deoxygenation, turbidity and eutrophication of the waters can lead to the replacement of the Spirodela-Hydrocharis vege tation by simpler Lemna communities. In the more open dykes with shelving, stepped or low banks which provide the most typical habitat for the community, and particularly where there is some regular physical cleaning of weed growth, the usual pattern is for the water margins to have a short, though sometimes quite luxurious, cover of Glycerio-Sparganion vege tation. Decumbent clumps of Glyceria fluitans and Agrostis stolonifera, or patches of Berula erecta and Apium nodiflorum, provide floristic continuity with the Spirodela-Hydrocharis community, and there can be scattered plants of Alisma plantago-aquatica or Nasturtium officinale, many of these able to make rapid regrowth if the disturbance has not been too gross. Then, there can be scattered patches of the Sparganie-tum erecti or Sagittaria sagittifolia swamp but, where taller emergents are represented, these tend to occur in clumps which alternate with the Spirodela-Hydrocharis community in less regularly maintained dykes, or to be set back some way from it on a shelving bank. A variety of swamps can be found in such situations, the Phragmi-tetum, the Glycerietum maximae, the Typhetum latifoliae and, in brackish waters, the Scirpetum maritimae, but, wherever these become densely shading, any duckweed vegetation surviving among the shoots tends to be of the impoverished Lemnetum minoris or Lemnetum gibbae.Similarly, where floating-leaved macrophyte vege tation such as the Polygonum amphibium or Nuphar lutea communities develop, these may shade out the submerged elements of the Spirodela-Hydrocharis as semblage and even overwhelm Hydrocharis itself, leav ing just fragmentary and species-poor duckweed mats. Where the waters remain relatively unshaded, however, other submerged aquatic communities can be found with this kind of vegetation, both Ceratophyllum demersum and Elodea canadensis being able to thicken up into virtually pure stands without a duckweed mat above them. In other places, the Spirodela-Hydrocharis community has been recorded with the Potamogeton pectinatus-Myriophyllum spicatum vegetation or, in more brackish habitats, the Potamogeton pectinatus community, Ceratophyllum submersi or Ranunculetum baudotii. Physical cleaning can readily allow this richer kind of duckweed vegetation to regenerate, but treatments which pollute, dirty or eutrophicate the waters to any degree will tend to eliminate the submerged species and simplify the assemblage to a floating mat of the Lemnetum minoris or the Lemnetum gibbae, communities which have probably ousted the Spirodela-Hydrocharis vegetation in many once suitable sites throughout its range. Distribution "
"a4","Zonation and succession The Hydrocharis-Stratiotes community persists as a local aquatic element in the fragmentary and abbreviated open-water transitions of dykes and pools, pass ing landwards to swamp and fen, and being replaced by other aquatic vegetation with shifts in the trophic state and base richness of the waters. In the kind of extended open-water transitions des cribed by Pallis (1911) and Lambert & Jennings (1951), Stratiotes is shown growing beyond or persisting among emergent Scirpetum lacustris, Typhetum angustifoliae and Typhetum latifoliae swamps, and in the pools and dykes where it survives today, very narrow strips or clumps of such communities can be interposed between it and the banks, together with patches of other swamps like the Phragmitetum. Or, the open waters may give way sharply to fen vegetation, usually in Broadland of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum, the more species-poor Phragmites-Eupatorium fen or the eutrophic Phrag-mites-Urtica fen. Where the waters became more enriched in nitratenitrogen, calcium and magnesium, Wheeler & Giller (1982/?) showed that the dykes of the Catfield-Irstead fens supported a fairly rich kind of Elodea canadensis vegetation, from which Stratiotes, Utricularia vulgaris and Myriophyllum verticillatum were absent, but where floristic continuity was maintained through the floating element of the flora. Towards the other extreme, where the waters were impoverished, this element also per sisted, though in a rather attenuated form, together with M. verticillatum, Potamogeton obtusifolius and Nuphar lutea, with Utricularia vulgaris usually the most abundant plant. In this scheme, such assemblages are best retained here as fragmentary stands. In spatial terms, this environmental and floristic gradient was disposed through the dyke system, running from the fen margin to its centre. Distribution "
"a5","Zonation and succession In shaded stretches of sluggish, eutrophic waters in the British lowlands, the Ceratophylletum demersi can dominate to the virtual exclusion of other kinds of aquatic vegetation, especially by mid-to late summer. In many tree-lined drainage ditches, for example, and in slow-moving streams receiving run-off from intensive agricultural land, the more species-poor sub-community may just be associated with stands of Elodea and a surface mat of the Lemnetum minoris or Lemnetum gibbae where conditions are not so shady. The Potamogeton pectinatus community can also figure in these simpler zonations, particular where the waters are strongly enriched or polluted. More varied sequences or mosaics involving the Ceratophylletum demersi are seen in clean and well-lit, standing or sluggish waters. Here, in pools, ditches and streams in the lowlands, it can occur, often as the richer Ranunculus sub-community, beneath Spirodela-Hydro charis mats or, in a few localities in Broadland, among the Hydrocharis-Stratiotes vegetation. Floating-leaved Nuphar lutea stands can also occur, particularly where the Ceratophylletum extends into deeper, slow-moving waters. Then, among the submerged aquatic element, the community may pass to the Potamogeton-M. spicatum vegetation, typically yielding to this assemblage, or to festoons of Callitriche stagnalis, in more quickmoving streams. Associated swamps are varied, but more mesophytic emergents such as Phragmites, Typha latifolia, Glyceria maxima and Sparganium erectum are the usual dominants around open waters with the Ceratophylletum, and fragments of the community may persist for some time as these thicken up during terrestrialisation of silting ditches and pools. Distribution "
"a6","Zonation and succession The community has been noted, either alone or with other aquatic vegetation, in distinctive zonations of brackish open-water transitions. It can show a rather sporadic pattern of occurrence from season to season and is eventually succeeded, where pools and dykes are not regularly cleaned, by swamp and fen. A quite common pattern seems to be for the Ceratophylletum to occur amongst the emergent shoots of the Scirpetum maritimi, one of the most frequent swamp communities of shallower brackish waters, or the Scir petum tabernaemontani, an under-recorded vegetation type but one also more tolerant of moderately saline conditions. From a marginal zone, the community can extend out beyond such swamps, comprising the only aquatic element of the zonation or occurring with other submerged assemblages tolerant of brackish conditions, notably certain kinds of Myriophyllum spicatum-Potamogeton pectinatus vegetation, where the only difference is sometimes the absence of C. submersum. Where the waters become less saline, both these communities can maintain an abundant presence, but the surface often becomes covered with a floating mat of the Lemnetum minoris, and the marginal swamps can then include the Phragmitetum or patches of Glycerio-Sparganion vegetation or Agrostis-Alopecurus wet grassland, decumbent shoots of which can trail out into open water. Patterns of these kinds can be clearly seen among the various ditch types characterised from the North Kent Marshes (Charman 1981). Distribution "
"a7","Zonation and succession The Nymphaeetum often occurs towards the limit of the zone of floating-leaved vegetation in open waters, sometimes comprising the only member of this element, or being accompanied by other floating-leaved or floating communities. Submerged aquatic vegetation can occur beneath it where the shading effect of the leaf laminae is not too intense, and the community sometimes persists among more open stands of emergents colonising the margins of open waters. In more mesotrophic lakes and pools in lowland Britain, the Nymphaeetum can monopolise the water surface, or occur intermixed with remnants of a floating mat of the Lemnetum minoris or, much more locally, of the Spirodela-Hydrocharis community, persisting from an earlier stage in colonisation. Sometimes, too, there can be a mosaic with patches of the Potamogeton natans community, another floating-leaved vegetation type able to extend into deeper water. Then, beneath, there is occasionally some Elodea canadensis vegetation, though this is more often associated with the Nuphar community. Even in deeper places, emergents can begin to colonise waters with the Nymphaeetum, and it is quite often seen growing among the shoots of the Scirpetum lacustris or, in shallower areas, among open stands of the Typhetum angustifoliae, the Typhetum latifoliae or the Phragmitetum. Denser zones of these swamps or, in other places, of the Caricetum ripariae, can then replace the aquatic vegetation around the water margins. In open waters towards the north and west, surface mats of duckweeds are scarce and the Nymphaeetum, sometimes mixed with the Potamogeton natans community, is often the only aquatic vegetation breaking the surface. In less nutrient-poor lakes, the Elodea canadensis community can again be present beneath or, more locally, the Potamogeton perfoliatus-Myriophyllum alterniflorum vegetation. The species-poor M. alterniflorum community can also grow under the Nymphaeetum canopy in more oligotrophic lakes and pools, but quite a common pattern in such situations is for the water-lily vegetation, often the Juncus-Potamogeton sub-community, to grow through some kind of Littor-ella-Lobelia sward. Emergent stands of the Scirpetum lacustris can complicate such zonations, even in quite deep water, and this kind of Nymphaeetum often extends back into shallower places, where other swamp communities, notably the Caricetum rostratae and the Equisetetum fluviatile, are colonising the margins. Where the Juncus-Potamogeton sub-community occurs in peaty pools and bog soakways, it is often found in association with the Juncus bulbosus community. In more nutrient-rich waters, the Nymphaeetum should eventually be succeeded by some kind of Phrag-mitetalia swamp, but the kinds of zonations seen in more oligotrophic open-water transitions seem to change little over many decades and cannot really be said to represent a simple hydrosere. Distribution "
"a8","Zonation and succession Even more so than the Nymphaeetum, the Nuphar community occurs towards the outer limit of floatingleaved vegetation in British waters, sometimes with remnants of free-floating communities, or alone or with stands of other floating-leaved aquatics. Beneath, there can be assemblages of submerged plants, free-floating or rooted, and the community sometimes persists towards the outer fringe of more open or patchy stands of emergents colonising the water margins. In the more eutrophic waters of which the Nuphar community is especially characteristic, it naturally develops as a successor to free-floating vegetation like the Lemnetum minoris or, more locally, the Spirodela-Hydrocharis community, and patches of these can persist, temporarily or locally, among the water-lily leaves as they come to assert dominance, or remain on the sheltered water surface in a zone landwards of the Nuphar community. Other floating-leaved communities can figure in such zonations, too, notably the Polygonum amphibium vegetation: this plant sometimes trails out into sufficiently deep water to form an element of richer Nuphar stands, but it may develop virtually pure covers behind the Nuphar vegetation or thicken up locally in mosaics of the two. Where Nymphaea alba assumes extensive dominance in waters where the two species occur together, such patterns are again best considered as mosaics of the Nuphar community and the Nymphaeetum, with just more fine-textured mixtures being included in the Nymphaea sub-community of the former vegetation type. This type of Nuphar vegetation and the Species-poor sub-community often have little in the way of associated submerged aquatic assemblages, but with the Callitriche-Zannichellia sub-community in particular there can be strong continuity with locally dense stands of such vegetation. Elodea canadensis, for example, can thicken up beneath the Nuphar community and there can be patches of Callitriche vegetation. In larger standing water bodies, the various aquatic communities can form distinct zones in relation to depth, but patterns are often much more compressed and fragmentary in narrower dykes or the more slow-moving stretches of streams and rivers. The contribution from emergent vegetation varies in these different circumstances, too. Where the Nuphar community is growing towards its depth limit, it is generally impossible for any swamp dominants to gain a hold, although the Scirpetum lacustris can survive in waters well over 1 m deep and is frequently seen among the inner fringe of the Nuphar zone or forming a belt nearing the shore. In shallower waters, the Nuphar community can be re placed by stands of a variety of emergents, in belts of the Phragmitetum, the Typhetum latifoliae, the Typhetum angustifoliae, the Caricetum paniculatae, the Glycerietum maximae or the Phalaridetum, and where terrestria-lisation is active, these can be seen as ultimately re placing the aquatic vegetation. Across narrow dykes and small streams, zonations are less well marked, clumps of various of these swamp communities occurring in the shallows along the length of the water-body, sometimes alternating with stretches of open water where there is advanced overgrowth. In such circumstances, too, the Nuphar community can be closely associated with various kinds of Glycerio-Sparganion water-margin vegetation, in which such plants as Apium, Veronica beccabunga and smaller Glyceria spp. can trail out into the water. Where the Nuphar community extends into northern and western Britain, it can sometimes be found, in more eutrophic waters, in patterns which preserve this general character, occurring with the Polygonum community, over stands of Elodea vegetation, in lakes and pools, and giving way landwards to the Scirpetum swamp, or to the Phragmitetum or Typhetum latifoliae. Usually, in such situations, the Nuphar vegetation is represented by the Potamogeton-Juncus sub-community, and where P. natans occurs in the floating-leaved element, this can thicken up locally to form virtually pure stands that can extend out into even deeper water. Another unusual feature in some Scottish lakes is the occurrence of this kind of Nuphar vegetation over the Potamogeton perfoliatus-Myriophyllum alterniflorum community and swards of Littorella-Lobelia vegetation, a pattern more associated with the Nymphaeetum (Spence 1964). Where the Nuphar community occurs in these less eutrophic waters, the surrounding swamps, which are often of the Caricetum rostratae type, seem to encroach only very slowly, if at all. Distribution "
"a9","Zonation and succession The P. natans community can form the only floatingleaved element in sequences of aquatic vegetation, or occur with other free-floating or floating-leaved com munities, when it often occupies the deepest water. It can occur over a variety of less nutrient-demanding sub merged assemblages and, in shallower conditions, will persist among more open stands of colonising emergent vegetation. Although the Nuphar community is less tolerant of nutrient-poor conditions than the P. natans vegetation, the two can be found together in mesotrophic pools and sluggish streams, often with remnants of the Lemnetum minoris or, more locally, the Spirodela-Hydrocharis community among the floating leaves. Sometimes, too, the Polygonum amphibium community is represented in such mosaics and in narrow dykes and small ponds or where river margins have but a fragmentary fringe of floating-leaved vegetation, the different assemblages are often found as just small stands in jumbled mosaics (Tansley 1911, 1939, Butcher 1933). In other places, the vegetation can be zoned with the P. natans community in deeper water than the Nuphar stands or where there is less silting (Godwin 1923). Beneath the P. natans in these kinds of patterns, the submerged associates of the Elodea sub-community sometimes thicken up to form a stand of Elodea vegetation. Associated swamps, colonising shallower waters, but eventually overwhelming the P. natans community where terrestrialisation proceeds unhindered, are of the more mesotrophic type, with the Typhetum latifoliae, the Sparganietum erecti or various kinds of Glycerio-Sparganion assemblage frequently represented (Walker 1905). Species-poor P. natans vegetation can also be found in zonations in more oligotrophic waters of streams and lakes in north-west Britain, although here the Juncus-Myriophyllum sub-community is especially characteristic of less turbulent waters. Sometimes, the Nymphaeetum occurs with the P. natans vegetation or, where there is a little more enrichment, the Nuphar community, this latter often marking local deposition of silty material as across the mouths of inflow streams (Pearsall 1921). And, where there is a depth-related zonation, the P. natans typically extends out further than the water-lily vegetation (Spence 1964). The Juncus-Myriophyllum sub-community can be found over the Potamogeton perfoliatus-Myriophyllum alterniflorum vegetation in some places but, quite commonly, there is some kind of Littorella-Lobelia sward beneath. A variety of emergents can colonise the margins of standing water bodies with the Scirpetum lacustris often penetrating quite deeply, the Equisetetum fluviatilis and Caricetum rostra-tae occurring in shallower waters. In many lakes, terrestrialisation seems to proceed very slowly away from sites with abundant deposition of silt. Distribution "
"cg1","Zonation and succession Stands of the Festuca-Carlina grassland generally occur as relatively small islands of open, rocky vegetation within more extensive tracts of closed swards or patchworks of grassland, heath and scrub. Much of this variation is explicable in terms of an edaphic transition in moving from the limestone exposures with their often fragmentary and highly calcareous soils to areas of deeper and moister soils which, in the absence of heavy grazing, become invaded by ericoids or other shrubs. In many places, and especially where exposures of bedrock are low and much fractured, the community may cover entire outcrops. In some sites, however, the cliffs are more substantial and here the Festuca-Carlina grassland may become fragmented in the crevices and on the ledges of the rock face and give way over the more massive exposures to fern-dominated stands of the Asplénium trichomanes-Fissidens cristatus community in narrow fissures. Some of the species of the Festuca-Carlina grassland, such as certain of the pauciennials and Draba aizoides, can survive in this more chasmo-phytic vegetation. Elsewhere, on more unstable areas of bare limestone, where there is clitter and shifting accumulations of wind-blown organic and mineral detritus, there can be a transition to the more ephemeral vegetation of the Thero-Airion. On grazed sites (which are the majority), the most common transition around stands of the community is to some form of the Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis grassland, frequently, on these warm, south-facing slopes, the Helianthemum nummularium-Filipendula vul garis variant of the Typical sub-community. As the soil cover becomes more continuous and slightly deeper (though remaining calcareous and base-rich), the sward thickens up and there is a switch to a more obviously grass-dominated turf with an increase in Mesobromion dicotyledons and a reduction in the frequency of pauciennials. Often, such junctions are marked by a strong vicarism between either H. apenninum or H. canum and H. nummularium, patterns which have been strikingly depicted by Proctor (1958). In those sub-communities where Koeleria vallesiana occurs (the Carex humilis and Trinia glauca sub-communities), there may be a similar abrupt switch to K. macrantha', elsewhere, this latter species runs right through the grasslands to even the most strongly parched stands of the Festuca-Carlina community. Variations in the sub-surface configuration of the limestone or local accumulations of loess or head can complicate such transitions. Then, more calcifuge com munities developed over the deeper and initially less calcareous or superficially leached and acidified soils, can occur in close contact with the Festuca-Carlina grassland. This kind of mosaic is very characteristic where the Festuca-Scilla sub-community occurs on the Gower cliffs in West Glamorgan (South Gower Coast Report 1981). In the more maritime sites, as in Gower and on Brean Down, there is the additional complexity imposed by gradients, running more or less normal to the coastline, of salt-spray deposition. Here, stands of the Festuca-Scilla and Carex humilis sub-communities may have occasional records for certain maritime species and give way towards the sea to the Festuca-Armeria grassland or directly to the crevice vegetation of the Crithmo-Spergularietum on sea-splashed rocks. Likewise, transitions to Thero-Airion and heath communities further up the cliffs may involve more maritime vegetation types like the Armeria-Cerastium therophyte community or the Calluna-Scilla heath. It is doubtful whether grazing is necessary to maintain the openness of the more extreme habitats of the community, where topographic and climatic conditions are probably sufficient to prevent the development of a closed sward, subsequent invasion of shrubs and the formation of a closed woody canopy. However, bird-sown seed of shrubs can germinate in rock crevices and, if grazing is relaxed on the slopes where the community occurs, stands can be encroached upon by scrub relatively quickly: thus, Proctor (1958) noted a marked change in some stands of the Scilla-Euphorbia sub community on Anstey's Cove in Devon in only three years following the demise of rabbits from myxomatosis. Ligustrum vulgare seems to be the most characteristic early invader, but Crataegus monogyna, Rubus frutico-sus agg. and, at some sites, the Himalayan introduction Cotoneaster microphylla, have also been recorded. In the sunny gaps within this patchy cover, tussocks of Brachypodium sylvaticum can grow up together with prominent plants of Teucrium scorodonia, Geranium sanguineum and Centaurea scabiosa with, in the shade beneath the shrubs, sprawls of Hedera helix. In time, such vegetation probably develops into the kind of wind-cut spinose scrub characteristic of many ungrazed sea cliffs. In some cases, where such scrub is encroaching more slowly from areas of deeper soil, it may grade to the Festuca-Carlina grassland through an intermediate zone of rank Avenula pubescens grassland with its characteristic mixture of Mesobromion herbs, tall grasses and dicotyledons and seedling shrubs or, in more maritime situations, through the Festuca rubra-Daucus carota ssp. gummifer grassland (South Gower Coast Report 1981). Some of the chamaephytes and pauciennials of the Festuca-Carlina grassland seem to be able to persist for some time in more open areas but they are soon overwhelmed by the taller herbage. Distribution "
"cg10","Zonation and succession The community is very frequently found in zonations of vegetation types related to geological and edaphic variation and, at some localities, forms part of altitudinal sequences influenced primarily by climate. Sometimes, such patterns are complicated by serai changes mediated by grazing. The most widespread kind of edaphically-influenced zonation is found where the typically small exposures of calcareous rocks which carry this community give way to less calcareous rocks which generally make up the bulk of the surrounding landscape (Figure 23). At such junctions, there is a switch to less base-rich brown earths or, in regions of higher rainfall, to various kinds of podzol, and this is marked by transitions from the Trifolium-Luzula or Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea sub communities to less calcicolous vegetation such as the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland or various kinds of upland heath. Ordered sequences of such communities have been systematically related to variables such as calcium content and pH of the soil in the Southern Uplands (e.g. Heddle & Ogg 1936, Nicholson & Robertson 1958, King 1962) and patchworks of these vege tation types are a very common feature of many upland areas, such as north Wales (Ratcliffe 1959zz, Edgell 1969), the Lake District, the northern Pennines (Eddy et al. 1969) and on the Dalradian rocks of the east-central Highlands (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Ratcliffe 1977). Very often, such patterns are complicated by an overlay of drift which masks the immediate influence of the underlying bedrock and increases drainage impedence. Then grasslands dominated by such species as Nardus stricta, Juncus squarrosus or Deschampsia cespitosa and wet heaths or ombrogenous mires may be added to the mosaics. The resulting close juxtaposition of these different vegetation types over complex mountain topographies is well illustrated in the vegetation maps of the Carneddau (Ratcliffe 1959zz) and Cader Idris (Edgell 1969) in north Wales and a more straightforward pat tern has been described from the dip slopes of Carboniferous sandstones with intruded Whin Sill along Hadrian's Wall by Lock & Rodwell (1981). Where there is flushing with base-rich waters within stands of the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, a different kind of sequence occurs. Then, the Trifolium Figure 23.

This, in turn, may be a transition to solige-nous mire, the Pinguiculo-Caricetum dioicae, or, par ticularly in the Scottish Highlands, the Carici-Saxifra-getum aizoidis. Sometimes, both these vegetation types are involved in complex patterns around strongly-flushed sites within stands of Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland (e.g. McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). Where drip ping rock outcrops intrude into the vegetation, the Saxifraga-Ditrichum sub-community may pass sharply to Cratoneurion spring vegetation or to Saxifraga-Alchemilla banks: such patterns have been well des cribed from cliffs within Dalradian schists and epidiorites (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Huntley 1979), from banks on Hoy (Prentice & Prentice 1975) and around springs on the Jurassic and Durness limestones of Skye (Birks 1973) and they occur more fragmentarily in the Lake District and Upper Teesdale (e.g. Eddy et al. 1969, Jones 1973). Where there are considerable expanses of more base rich rocks and soils in the uplands or repeated sets of exposures at progressively higher altitudes, the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland can be seen in climatically-related sequences. Essentially, it seems to be the sub montane counterpart of the dwarf-herb vegetation of the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene community (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962) and it gives way to this vegetation at altitudes above about 750 m at certain sites in the Scottish Highlands. Frequently, such transitions also involve the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath, which extends to somewhat higher levels than the Fes tuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland and is perhaps typical of somewhat less base-rich soils. On wetter soils, where there is more extensive flushing, greater drainage impe-dence or some effect of snow-lie, the community may give way above to montane Deschampsia-Galium grassland. The pastures within which the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland occurs are usually sufficiently heavily grazed to prevent any succession to the woodland which, in the majority of sites, would be the natural climax vegetation. It is very likely, however, that variations in such factors as the breed of stock, the social behaviour of the animals, and the palatability and seasonal availability of the herbage, play a considerable part in local differences in the grassland mosaics in which the community occurs, complicating the soil-and climate-related patterns. Changes in grazing may also mediate some successional developments between the grassland types: the spread of Nardus stricta in these swards, for example, may be encouraged by very intensive grazing, especially if it is uncontrolled (Heddle & Ogg 1936, Harris 1939) and involves more selective stock such as breeding ewes, rather than mixtures of cattle and wethers (Roberts 1959). Other unpalatable species, such as Prunella vulgaris, Cirsium spp. and bryophytes, may also increase locally with heavy graz ing (Rawes & Welch 1969) or there may be a run-down, on very heavily trampled sites, to vegetation with some resemblances to Lolio-Plantaginion communities in which Poa annua is conspicuous (e.g. Ratcliffe 1959«). Some indication of early changes with a cessation of grazing have been provided by enclosure experiments at Moor House in the northern Pennines (Welch & Rawes 1969). At this site, it was grasses, such as Festuca rubra, F. ovina, Agrostis capillaris, Deschampsia cespitosa and D. flexuosa (the last a rare grass under normal circumstances here), which showed a marked increase, at the expense of most of the important herbaceous dicotyledons of the community and the bryophytes and lichens. Despite the occasional occurrence of certain ericoids in this community, there was no development of heath vegetation in this experiment. On inaccessible ledges, it is often the increase in height and cover of tall dicotyledons which is the most noticeable response to lack of grazing, especially where such sites are kept moist by dripping water. Then Deschampsia cespitosa may also increase and the vegetation take on the appearance of tall-herb ledge communities. Transitions to this kind of vegetation have been recorded from the Welsh mountains (Ratcliffe 1959, Edgell 1969) and from Dalradian rocks in Scotland (e.g. McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Huntley 1979) where the communities approach those of the Cicerbition alpini. At lower altitudes, woody species may invade such sites, as at Craig y Ciliau in the Brecon Beacons where endemic Sorbi are a notable feature (Ratcliffe 1977). In the complex topography of the Moorfoot cleughs, Fes tuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, tall-herb vegetation and scattered trees of Sorbus aucuparia, Fraxinus excelsior and Betula pubescens occur in jumbles of vegetation on the exposed rock faces (Ferreira 1978). In such sites, it is probably the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland that is the natural development of ungrazed stands of the community. At higher altitudes and latitudes, Dryas octopetala vegetation may be another derivative of ungrazed Fes tuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). Gradations to the Dry as-Silene community have been reported from ungrazed ledges on Dalradian rocks at The Cairn well (Coker 1969), Creag Mhor (Ratcliffe 1977) and Caenlochan (Huntley 1979) in the east-central Highlands and on the Durness Limestone above Inch-nadamph (Ratcliffe 1977). At lower altitudes in the north-west of Scotland, the community also occurs in close juxtaposition with Dryas-Carex heath as on the Durness Limestone on Skye, where there are also woodland fragments in a pavement landscape which https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.029 Published online by Cambridge University PressCG10 Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Thymus praecox grassland 241 resembles the karst scenery of the Pennine Carboniferous (Birks 1973). Fencing experiments on the mainland Durness Limestone should help reveal the relationships between the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland and these less heavily grazed communities (Ratcliffe 1977). Stands of the community which occur on deeper and better-drained colluvial soils on gentler slopes which are often adjacent to enclosed valley-bottom land are very susceptible to agricultural improvement by the addition of fertilisers. Although the effects of such treatment have not been followed, it is likely that the Trifolium-Luzula sub-community typical of such sites would progress to some kind of Lolio-Cynosuretum, provided grazing were maintained. Distribution "
"cg11","Zonation and succession Most often, zonations between the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath and other vegetation types reflect edaphic or altitudinal/climatic gradients or differences in grazing intensity. At some sites, the community gives way, over frag mentary lithomorphic soils developed over the same substrate, to more open vegetation, as on Skye, where it passes to scree communities on Tertiary basalt talus or pavement vegetation on Durness Limestone (Birks 1973). More usually, however, it occurs, often with the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, within patch works of other communities whose distribution reflects the occurrence of different bedrock types and the extent of overlying drift. Where calcareous deposits are well represented, stands can be more extensive, as on Ben Lawers, in Caenlochan and Beinn a’Ghlo (Ratcliffe 1977, Huntley 1979); elsewhere, typical but smaller https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.030 Published online by Cambridge University PressCG11 Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Alchemilla alpina grass-heath 249 stands occur as islands within predominantly calcifuge grasslands and heaths over acid rocks or deep drift, as on the gneisses of the north-western Highlands (Ratcliffe 1977). Where suitable rocks extend over a considerable range of altitude, as on the Dalradian schists, the community may be part of altitudinal sequences which reflect the increasing cold and rainfall at higher alti tudes. Then, it may give way below to the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland and above to the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene dwarf-herb community. The occurrence of crags within stands of the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath is a common feature and, at higher altitudes, the community forms mosaics here with the Dryas-Silene vegetation which reflect the lack of grazing on the more inaccessible ledges. Good examples of this kind of pattern have been described from Beinn a’Ghlo on Dalradian limestone and from Lewisian gneiss in Ross and Sutherland (Ratcliffe 1977) and the occasional prominence of taller herbs is encountered wherever grazing is restricted. Distribution "
"cg12","Zonation and succession The community occurs as part of vegetation mosaics which are related primarily to geological and edaphic variation and in altitudinal sequences which reflect climatic differences. Variation in grazing intensity is also important in influencing some zonations. Where the exposures of calcareous rocks are more restricted, as among the gneisses of the north-west Highlands and the Moine metasediments, the community occurs, sometimes as very small and fragmentary stands, in patchworks of calcicolous vegetation which provide a spectacular local enrichment on and around crags which intrude into more calcifugous communities over acidic rocks and drift. This kind of pattern is very characteristic of parts of Ben Nevis, Ben Alder and Beinn Dearg (Ratcliffe 1977). Where exposures are more extensive, notably on the Dalradian mica-schists around Breadalbane, stands are larger, sometimes of several hectares, and form a major part of considerable expanses of calcicolous vegetation in which the influence of variables such as the extent of snow-lie and the amount of flushing can be more clearly seen. In such sites this community may give way, in more sheltered positions and on cooler, north-facing slopes, to the more chionophilous vegetation of the Alchemilla alpina-Sibbaldiaprocumbens community. In other cases, and perhaps on sites where there is only a moderate influence of snow-lie but where the moist soils are somewhat less base-rich, there may be transitions to more species-rich types of Deschampsia-Galium grassland and, towards lower altitudes, Nardus-Galium or Juncus-Festuca grasslands. Where soligenous flushing becomes more pro nounced at higher altitudes, the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene community can give way to montane Caricion davallianae mires such as the Caricetum saxatilis or the Carici-Saxifragetum and, where dripping rock faces protrude, there may be more abrupt transitions to Saxifraga-Alchemilla banks. Complex mosaics of all these vegetation types, together with soligenous mires characteristic of flushing with less base-rich waters, are a prominent feature of Ben Lawers. Here, too, where calcareous rocks extend over con siderable altitudes, there are some good sequences from the community to sub-montane vegetation types, down through the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath to the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland or, where de creasing altitude is accompanied by some lessening of flushing with base-rich waters or increasing contamination with drift, to Nardus-Galium and Juncus-Festuca grasslands. A further, common zonation, probably mediated primarily by the intensity of grazing, occurs where the community gives way, over the inaccessible ledges and crevices of cliffs, to stands of the Dryas-Silene community and in the often fragmented transitions between the two, vegetation with intermediate floristics is often found. Distribution "
"cg13","Zonation and succession Most often, zonations involving the Dryas-Carex heath are related to edaphic variation which is dependent upon the topography and geology. The exposures of calcareous bedrocks in the north-west of Scotland, of which the Hieracium-Ctenidium sub-community is especially characteristic, are usually of limited extent and surrounded by more acid rocks. Stands of this vegetation are thus often small and they make up part of the patchworks of calcicolous communities that provide such a startling intrusion of fresh green into the dull brown cover that characterises much of this area. The outcrops are also frequently broken into cliffs, and dissected by crevices and grikes. Typically, therefore, this sub-community occurs in complex mosaics with fern-domination in crevice protorendzinas and woodland fragments in sheltered clefts and ravines. Such patterns are very well seen in the Suardal area of Skye (Birks 1973) and, to a more limited extent, around Durness (Ratcliffe 1977). At higher altitudes, on the hills above Inchnadamph, comparable mosaics involve montane chasmophytic vegetation, tall-herb communities and willow scrub (Poore & McVean 1957, McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Ratcliffe 1977). Very often, too, the exposures, especially on flatter land at lower altitudes, are smeared with varying amounts of drift which introduces a further element of complexity. Then the Dryas-Carex heath may pass to more calcifugous heath, perhaps through an intermediate zone in which Calluna vulgaris and Nardo-Galion grasses show an increase in cover. Flushing can complicate the pattern still further. Where this is intermittent, the community may persist with scattered Cari-cion davallianae species in the sward but, where it is more pronounced, there are transitions to sub-montane soligenous mires. Where base-poor waters flow through drift-contaminated soils adjacent to Dryas-Carex heath, the community may show a sharp transition to some kind of calcifuge mire. Comparable patterns to these can be seen within and around areas of shell-sand along the north Scottish coast, where the Salix-Empetrum sub-community is more common, though here the zonations can have more diffuse boundaries because of the continuously variable thicknesses of sand that are laid down. The open chasmophytic communities of bare rock are also replaced by vegetation typical of raw sand and, with increasing proximity to the sea, there is the additional feature of maritime influence. Thus, around Inver-narver, Dryas-Carex heath occurs behind dune communities and among maritime heath, notably the Empetrum sub-community of the Calluna-Scilla heath. Disturbed areas within stands of the community may carry small patches of the Armer ia-Cerastium maritime therophyte community. Further away from the sea, where the influence of deposited sand peters out, there can be gradations to various kinds of inland heath over acidic mineral soils and peat. As before, varying degrees of flushing with waters of differing base-status result in the scattered occurrence of small-sedge mires of various kinds (Ratcliffe 1977). Both sub-communities are also frequently found in close association with small patches of sub-montane swards, such as the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland or, along the north Scottish coast, the Festuca-Plantago maritime grassland. At somewhat higher altitudes, as along the slopes of the Trotternish ridge in Skye or above Inchnadamph, it may grade to the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath (Birks 1973, Ratcliffe 1977). The presumption is that such zonations are mediated primarily by grazing which, when very pro longed or heavy, is supposed to wipe out the D. octopetala (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). However, the survival of the community under grazing on Skye (Birks 1973, see above), like the persistence of D. octopetala in Sesleria-Galium grassland on the Pennines, suggests that this relationship may be quite complex (Elkington 1971). Enclosure experiments at Inchnadamph may help reveal some of the answers to this problem (Ratcliffe 1977). Distribution "
"cg14","Zonation and succession Most often, zonations between the community and other vegetation types are a direct reflection of the extent of grazing, though edaphic transitions related to bed rock and soil type are also found. Very commonly, the Dryas-Silene community passes, where ledges become more accessible, to grazed calcicolous vegetation over the more intact soils of the sur rounding smoother topography. The communities involved in such transitions vary with altitude. Around higher crags, there is typically a zonation to the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene community in which the representation of those Arctic-Alpines tolerant of grazing is maintained. Such mosaics are well seen towards the upper slopes of Ben Lawers, on Beinn Dearg and Ben Alder (Ratcliffe 1977) and, on Helvellyn, the very small fragments of the community survive among more extensive areas of dwarf-herb vegetation (Ratcliffe 1960, 1977). Towards lower altitudes, the community gives way to the more sub-montane vegetation of the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath and the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland as on the lower slopes of Ben Lawers, on Beinn Laoigh, in the Caenlochan-Clova area and on Meall Ghaordie and Beinn Iadain. It is very likely that each of these three communities has, in part, been derived by grazing from the Dryas-Silene vege tation which has been progressively restricted to the more inaccessible crags but it should be remembered that, around the margins of these exposures, there is frequently a coincidental edaphic shift to more intact and sometimes deeper soils, even though the underlying bedrock remains calcareous. It may be presumed that the frequent instability of the crag environment with its exposure to erosion by frost and wind, and the often precarious hold of the vegetation on ledges, help maintain the characteristic patchwork of plants of differing stature. For the most part, stands are at altitudes which are too high for colonisation by trees and much of this vegetation represents a climax dependent on the extreme climatic and edaphic conditions. Sometimes, however, the willows form a more intact cover, shading out many of the species of the community, and transitions to such low scrub can be seen on Meall na Samhna, Carn Gorm and Beinn Dearg (Ratcliffe 1977). Grazing-related zonations such as these can be com plicated where there are edaphic variations attributable to differences in the underlying bedrock and/or the character of percolating waters. Then, other less calcicolous vegetation types may occur in close association with the Dryas-Silene community. For example, where isolated calcareous crags intrude into areas of acid bedrocks, a common feature among the Moine and Lewisian Assemblages, Nardus-Galium, Juncus-Festuca or Deschampsia-Galium grasslands may surround stands of the community. In other cases, complexes of ledges run across geological boundaries or receive irrigation with waters of varying calcium carbonate content. Where flushing with less calcareous waters occurs, the Dryas-Silene vegetation can pass into other kinds of ungrazed tall-herb communities in which calcicoles are much more poorly represented. Such transitions are a prominent feature of parts of Ben Lawers, Beinn Laoigh, the Caenlochan-Clova area, Meall Ghaordie and Beinn Dearg (Ratcliffe 1977). Distribution "
"cg2","Zonation and succession Most of the zonations within stands of the Festuca-Avenula grassland or between the community and other vegetation types are related to topographic and soil variation or represent stages in successions mediated by treatment. Gradations between different sub-communities related to topographic modifications of climate are relatively uncommon. In some areas, the local physiography is such that even quite extensive stretches of the community are predominantly of one aspect, as along the scarps of the North and South Downs. Elsewhere, the effect of exposition is confused by variations in treatment or stands are so fragmented that they do not encompass the range of possible aspects within a single site. However, in some places, uniform treatment pre vails over rounded hills, scarp tops, circular or hemispherical ancient monuments or along the slopes of sharply-twisting valleys, and here transitions may be seen. In wetter regions, as on a very few localities on the South Downs, the Pseudoscleropodium-Prunella variant of the Cirsium-Asperula sub-community gives way, on south-facing slopes, to the Typical variant; in drier areas, such as parts of the Chiltern scarp, the Typical variant occupies north-facing slopes, passing to the Filipendula-Helianthemum variant on southerly expositions. To the west, as on hills and hill forts on the Dorset Chalk, or in the steep and narrow valleys of south-west Wiltshire, the Succisa-Leucanthemum sub-community is very characteristic of south-west aspects, grading to the Cirsium-Asperula sub-community (often the Pseudoscleropodium-Prunella variant) on north-facing slopes. Further north, there are a very few sites in the regional overlap of the Cirsium-Asperula and Dicranum sub communities where these two vegetation types pass one into the other with a change in aspect, e.g. parts of Dovedale in Derbyshire and on the Great Orme in Gwynedd. Very often, however, in all these cases, a number of discrete stands of the Festuca-Avenula grassland are needed to include this kind of variation. Some edaphic differences are probably involved in these topoclimatic patterns (e.g. Perring 1958,1959), but the effect of soil variation on zonations is much more clearly seen where sequences of profiles have developed over limestones partly overlain by different amounts and various kinds of superficial deposits. Strictly speaking, these soil sequences should not be described as catenas, because of the hybrid origin of some of the profiles (e.g. Balme 1953, Pigott 1962, Grime 19636, Bryan 1967): the sharpness of the edaphic transitions and the related vegetation patterns depend very much on the disposition of the superficial which is, in turn, related to topography. In general, however, the sequences are marked by an increase in the extent of the https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.021 Published online by Cambridge University Press152 Calcicolous grasslands soil cover and its depth, and a decline in the influence of the underlying calcareous bedrock on the development and character of the soils. In such situations, the Fes tuca-Avenula grassland can occur in suites of vegetation types which may run from very open calcicolous chasmophyte communities on exposed bedrock right through to heath over brown earths. As with aspect-related zonations, many such sequences have now been disturbed or disrupted by agricultural activity leaving modified remnants in dis junct array, but two kinds of intact sequences can still be seen. The first occurs where flatter limestone surfaces have an uneven cover of superficial which thins in places to shallow native rendzinas or rock exposures. Such patterns are best seen on the characteristic benches which develop on Carboniferous Limestone where the Festuca-Avenula grassland often forms a narrow zone towards their outer edges, giving way to heath further back and to some kind of open calcicolous vegetation over the rocky bench edge (rarely with pavement outside the limits of the Final Glaciation where the community is mostly found). On the western coastal exposures of the Carboniferous Limestone in the Mendips and Wales, where these rocky cliff tops are often very hot and dry, some very distinctive zonations of this kind occur with various types of Festuca-Carlina grassland grading to Festuca-Avenula grassland (often through the Filipendula-Helianthemum variant of the Cirsium-Asperula sub-community), then to Nardo-Galion grasslands and heath (e.g. Proctor 1956,1958, Shimwell 1968«, Rodwell 1974, South Gower Coast Report 1981). Sometimes, a more discontinuous cover of drift is reflected in complex mosaics of Festuca-Avenula grassland and heath (e.g. Gittins 1965«). Such patterns are rarer on the Chalk where the dip slope plateaus have been more systematically exploited for agriculture but fragments were described from Por ton Down on the Hampshire/Wiltshire border by Wells et al. (1976) where rendzinas carrying some Festuca-Avenula grassland were replaced locally by brown earths over Tertiary cappings with Nardo-Galion grasslands. At Lullington Heath in Sussex, Grubb et al. (1969) found some transitions from heath to Festuca-Avenula grassland where practice blast-bombing had blown away a cover of loess from the Chalk surface leaving a man-made rendziniform soil. (The much more complete sequences described by Watt (1940 et seq.) from the Breckland Chalk are considered under the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland.) The second and much more widespread situation occurs where soil sequences develop over the graded slopes of valley sides and the more rounded scarps of softer limestones. Here, slope rendzinas with Festuca-Avenula grassland pass, with varying degrees of abruptness at the brow-top, to drift-derived soils with Nardo-Galion grasslands and heath. The zonations described from the Derbyshire Dales (Balme 1953, Pigott 1962, Grime 1963/?, Shimwell 1968«, b) are of this kind and here, on the harder Carboniferous Limestone, the sequence may run on to screes and cliffs with a fragmentation of the Festuca-Avenula sward and its replacement by open fern-dominated or Thero-Airion vegetation on crevice protorendzinas. This element is usually lacking on the softer Chalk, although open communities do occur in those few places, as on river cliffs and in the gaps along the North and South Downs (e.g. Lousley 1950, Rose 1973), where bedrock is exposed. The basic sequence is, however, widespread in the south, although it is often truncated or fragmented by cultivation right to the scarp top and the conversion of the bulk of the dip slopes to arable (e.g. Hodgson 1967, Jarvis 1973, Cope 1976, Ratcliffe 1977, Jarvis et al. 1979). The particular sub-communities and variants of the Festuca-Avenula grassland involved in these zonations vary (largely in relation to regional and local climate) but especial interest attaches to the fact that the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community often forms a transition zone between the more calcicolous kind of Festuca-Avenula swards on the shallow rendzinas and the Nardo-Galion grasslands on the deeper brown earths. The soils under this sub-community are often contaminated with super-ficials as, for example, around deep drift deposits on plateaus or where, towards the upper parts of slopes, there is some downwash (Pigott 1962, Grime 1963/?) but, in general, they approximate to the calcareous brown earth type ('mull rendzina' in the older terminology). They are deeper, moister and somewhat more mesotrophic than rendzinas and, at least towards their surface, less calcareous and of lower pH. Not only does this combination of features promote a lusher and more mesophytic kind of Festuca-Avenula grassland but it also creates conditions which allow the invasion of certain calcifuges and the development of mixed vege tation which gives way to calcifugous swards and heath over the deeper drift (e.g. Pigott 1962, Grime 1963«, b, Grubb et al. 1969, Rodwell 1974). There is some evi dence that certain of the calcifugous invaders can acidify the soils in their rhizospheres (Grubb et al. 1969, Pigott 1970«) and this may allow a progressive advance of the Nardo-Galion grassland into the Festuca-Avenula swards, though some species of the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community can persist to provide the calcicolous element in what has become known as 'Chalk heath' or 'limestone heath'. Grazing also affects such changes because, if it is relaxed, such competitive power as the surviving calcicoles retain may be lost as the sward grows rank. Many areas showing the more subtle zonations between the Festuca-Avenula grassland and heaths, especially those on the Chalk, have been lost since the demise of rabbits in the myxomatosis epidemic (e.g. Grubb et al. 1969, Ratcliffe 1977). There is one further kind of zonation related to https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.021 Published online by Cambridge University PressCG2 Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis grassland 153 interactions between soil and climate and that is the type of pattern which develops where Festuca-Avenula grasslands come under the influence of salt-spray on coastal limestone exposures. Maritime influence is relatively low within the community itself, partly because some limestones, like the Chalk along the Channel coast, typically form very high cliffs whose tops are out of reach of spray. Even where stands are close to the sea, the influence of high calcium levels can overwhelm the impact of small amounts of salt-deposition such that there are just very occasional records for species such as Plantago maritima and Armeria maritima in what is essentially a typical Festuca-Avenula sward. In some places, however, the community grades to more maritime vegetation with increasing salt-spray influence, as on low Chalk cliffs and on the Carboniferous Limestone of the Gower coast. The usual pattern is for the community to give way down the cliff to the Sanguisorba sub-community of the Festuca-Daucus grassland or, on ledges and slumped chunks of cliff, to the Brassica community. Both these vegetation types preserve a calcicolous element though, with the decreased accessibility to grazing stock on such sites, these transitions are often marked by a striking increase in taller herbs and tussocks of Brachypodium pinnatum. Although some small measure of serai change in the Festuca-Avenula grassland may occur in response to pedogenesis (see above), it is variation in grazing pres sure that, above all, controls successions to and from the community. Whenever grazing is increased or relaxed to any marked degree, or when there are substantial shifts in the proportions of the different grazing animals, physiognomic and floristic changes ensue. These are easy to describe in general terms, though there are relatively few detailed studies on the subject. It is the effects of grazing relaxation that are nowadays the more obvious. With the general decline in sheep pastoralism since the First World War (Shrub 1973, Smith 1980) and the catastrophic reduction in the rabbit population in the 1954/5 myxomatosis epidemic (Lock-ley 1964, Sheail 1971), extensive areas of Festuca-Avenula grassland have become rank and overgrown by scrubby woodland (e.g. Ratcliffe 1977). The early enclosure experiment on a stand of the community at Downley Bottom A (Tansley 1922, Tansley & Adamson 1925, Hope-Simpson 1941 b) and later observations (e.g. Hope-Simpson 1940Z?, Thomas 1960,1963, Wells 1967«, 1969, 1973) give some indication of the processes involved. The first general change is that the sward grows taller and more uneven. Although there is often a flush of profuse flowering among the dicotyledons in the season after grazing ceases, it is the grasses which, in the longer term, make the most pronounced vegetative response. They produce more and lusher foliage which can accumulate, after death, as a layer of resistant litter and some develop a pronounced tussock habit. The increased competition for nutrients, water and, especially perhaps, for light, then begins to induce a second kind of general alteration in the sward, this time in its floristic composition. Some of the characteristic dicotyledons of the Fes tuca-Avenula grassland are quickly overwhelmed, e.g. Hieracium pilosella, Asperula cynanchica, Poly gala spp. and the therophytes and more delicate bryophytes of patches of bare ground. Others can maintain their position for some time in the ranker herbage by producing larger rosettes which depress or grow through the grasses (e.g. Cirsium acaule, Sanguisorba minor, Plantago lanceolata} or adopting a bushier habit and sprawling over them (e.g. Thymus praecox, T. pulegioides, Hippocrepis comosa, Helianthemum nummularium, Lotus corniculatus). Even here, however, there may be some reduction in flowering and seed production. Sur viving plants may become very attenuated and eventually die and they cannot easily be replaced because there is little well-illuminated ground where seedlings can become established. As a result of these changes, the sward begins to assume the composition and structure of a different vegetation type. Where there is no rapid invasion into the ungrazed sward of shrubs and trees, the nature of the derived vegetation depends partly on which grasses gain eventual ascendance and partly on which particular kind of Festuca-Avenula grassland is involved. The two are not unrelated because certain grasses are especially characteristic of different sub-communities or variants or appear particularly suited to invade one type of sward rather than another. Floristic variation in the original sward also determines which range of dicotyledonous associates is available to respond to the abandonment of grazing and the expansion of the grasses. Of those grasses which are frequent throughout the community, Avenula pratensis and Dactylis glomerata often become prominent in these circumstances and, in the more mesophytic vegetation of the Holcus-Trifolium sub community, Holcus lanatus can increase (e.g. Norman 1957, Kydd 1964). Even the more diminutive species such as Festuca ovina, Briza media and Koeleria macrantha can remain very frequent and locally abundant in ungrazed swards. For the most part, however, it is the coarser and much more aggressive tussock grasses that now begin to make their mark and become overwhelming dominants. The most important of these, at least over the southern part of the range of the community, are Bromus erectus and Brachypodiumpinnatum. Both are present in small amounts as low-frequency occasional in the Festuca-Avenula grassland, though they are less common, especially the former, in the northern Dicranum sub-community. They can also invade recently ungrazed swards, provided there is a seed source nearby, https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.021 Published online by Cambridge University Press154 Calcicolous grasslands although they may not be able to gain new entry into grasslands which have already grown rank. Once established, they respond strikingly to relaxation of grazing, expanding to overwhelm the neighbouring turf and converting the vegetation to communities in which each or both are dominant. The development of Bromus erectus grassland is reversible with a resumption of hard grazing and, even where this species continues to increase, the death and decay of the centres of its expanding clones may allow the reappearance of something resembling a Festuca-Avenula sward (Austin 1968tz). Brachypodium pinnatum is different. It is much less palatable and, once established, it can be extremely difficult to reduce, let alone eradicate. Even at the time of the earliest surveys (Tansley & Adamson 1925, Hope-Simpson 1940/?, 1941 b), grasslands dominated by these species were very widespread on the southern Chalk and they have continued to increase in extent since then. It is possible that some of the floristic variation within them is inherited from the original swards which they invaded. Both Bromus and Brachypodium grasslands exhibit a contrast between more calcicolous and more mesophytic types which reflects the distinction between the Cirsium-Asperula and Holcus-Trifolium sub communities of the Festuca-Avenula grassland. There is a third coarse and aggressive tussock grass which may be especially able to take advantage of the more mesotrophic conditions of which the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community is characteristic. This is Arr henatherum elatius, an occasional in these swards and a ready invader. Lack of grazing is a key factor in its expansion and it can quickly assume dominance to form an Arrhenatheretum, perhaps, in this case, of the kind included in the Centaurea nigra sub-community. It is, however, very palatable and resumption of grazing can reduce it to virtual insignificance in the sward (e.g. Thomas 1960, 1963, Wells 1969). Two further species are of importance here. Avenula pubescens is frequent in some kinds of Festuca-Avenula grassland, again more conspicuously in the more mesophytic Holcus-Trifolium sub-community but also in the Succisa-Leucanthemum sub-community, the floristics and environmental relationships of which are more complex. It, too, can increase very markedly when grazing is relaxed and some stands of grassland in which it is dominant may have developed from ungrazed Festuca-Avenula swards. Festuca rubra is a more com plex case. It is, in these data, much more uneven in its occurrence than F ovina, though it is invariably F rubra which is reported as becoming the more prominent of the two with lack of grazing. It is certainly very characteristic of some kinds of ungrazed calcicolous grassland, often in association with A. pubescens, though at some localities, like Swyncombe Down in Oxfordshire (Smith et al. 1971) and Porton Down on the Hampshire/ Wiltshire border (Wells et al. 1976), as an uncompromising dominant. Finally, and much more local in its importance, there is Brachypodium sylvaticum. This is a generally uncommon grass in Festuca-Avenula swards, assuming but patchy prominence under grazing and especially asso ciated with stands over harder limestones (like many in the Dicranum sub-community) where, incidentally, it is by no means always an indicator of former woodland. It can expand when grazing is relaxed and, being relatively unpalatable (e.g. Wells 1969), is less easily eradicated than, say, A. elatius, but it rarely forms a major component of closed, ungrazed swards over intact soils. The relationships between each of these species and the ungrazed environment, including its edaphic and climatic characteristics, are complex and little understood. Moreover, these grasses can often expand or invade together, producing a further element of com plexity in the derived communities. Also, many of the stands in which they are now dominant, either alone or in various combinations, originate not from ungrazed Festuca-Avenula swards but from much more grossly disturbed situations, as, for example, where calcicolous grassland has been ploughed and abandoned. Some of the intricacies of these relationships are examined under the descriptions of the various communities in which these species are dominant. Shrubs and trees can invade ungrazed Festuca-Avenula grassland rapidly if there are nearby seed sources, and the expansion and closure of a woody canopy may then proceed alongside or overtake changes in the herbaceous component of the vegetation (as in the Downley enclosure which was adjacent to a woodland). The most widespread early invaders seem to be Crataegus monogyna, Prunus spinosa, Rubus fruticosus agg., Rosa spp. and Ligustrum vulgare with, thinning northwards, Rhamnus catharticus and Cornus sanguinea and, around disturbed and enriched sites, Sambucus nigra. These can thicken up quite quickly to form stands of various kinds of Crataegus-Hedera scrub, the edges of which often become clothed in tangles of Clematis vitalba. A number of orchids, notably Aceras anthropophorum, Himantoglossum hircinum and the very rare Orchis militaris, are particularly associated with the ranker ungrazed Festuca-Avenula swards found around the margins of such scrub. Two much more local invaders which can form distinctive kinds of scrub are Juniperus communis ssp. communis and Buxus sempervir-ens. The further development of these communities to mixed deciduous, Fagus and Taxus woodlands is con sidered in the volume on Woodlands and Scrub. The consequences of very heavy grazing of Festuca-Avenula grasslands are now much more rarely seen than in the days of rabbit infestation between the World Wars https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.021 Published online by Cambridge University PressCG2 Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis grassland 155 and into the 1950s when their impact became especially obvious with the decline in numbers of sheep. Then, their vociferous nibbling and scraping, their dunging and urinating on the sward and their excavations in the softer strata and superficial deposits, produced striking and very widespread effects (see, for example, plates 2 and 3 in Tansley 1939 and figure 5 in Hope-Simpson 19406). In some areas, their numbers have risen again as less virulent strains of myxomatosis have stabilised within the population. Their general effect on the Festuca-Avenula grassland seems to be to convert it to the kind of vegetation that is included in the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland, the community on which most of the classic studies of the effects of rabbits have been carried out (Farrow 1917, Watt 1940 etseq.). Here, there is a marked reduction in the numbers and cover of more palatable grasses, sedges and dicotyledons and a rise to prominence of certain bryophytes, notably Hypnum cupressiforme, Homalothecium lutescens and Pseudoscleropodium purum, in the more open sward. Also, with the greater disturbance, there is an increase in weedy species, not only those therophytes which are characteristic of open areas within the Festuca-Avenula grassland, but also grosser species such as Senecio jacobaea, Erigeron acer and Fragaria vesca. It was the local abundance of these, together with patches of, for example, Urtica dioica, Arctium spp., Verbascum thap-sus, Hyoscyamus niger, Atropa belladonna and Solanum dulcamara, often attaining a grand stature on the rich burrow spoil, that gave the old rabbit warrens their distinctive, and often highly peculiar, appearance (e.g. Tansley & Adamson 1925, Thomas 1960, 1963). Variations in grazing intensity in the Festuca-Avenula grassland have a very considerable impact, not only on the vegetation itself, but also on its often very characteristic invertebrate populations (e.g. Duffey 1962 ö, b, Duffey et al. 1974, Morris 1967, 1968, 1969, 1971a, b, 1973). The complex relationships between the numerous and varied species and the plants are an essential part of the Festuca-Avenula grassland environment and make themselves felt through inter-dependencies such as those involved in pollination. Many of these effects are subtle and hidden. One often very obvious impact of the invertebrate fauna on the vegetation, however, is that produced by the mound-building activities of ants, especially Lasius flavus (Thomas 1962, Grubb et al. 1969, Wells et al. m, King 1977a, b, c). The hills produced by this species are large and roughly hemispherical and they introduce an element of structural complexity into stands of the Festuca-Avenula grassland, especially on the southern Chalk, which long outlasts their occupation; indeed, the ant-hills may even outlast the grassland, persisting after the abandonment of grazing and beyond the development of a woodland cover.The soil of the ant-hills is structurally finer and less dense than that of the surrounding intact profiles, though it does not seem to be significantly different in its chemical properties. It is also more free-draining and subject to greater fluctuations of temperature, the dry ing and heating being especially marked on the southern face. The mounds are also subject to various kinds of disturbance by rabbits, which use them as latrines, and various ant-eating or dust-bathing birds. Both sheep and rabbits may graze them preferentially, especially where the surrounding vegetation has grown rank. These effects combine to produce a complex floristic mosaic within Festuca-Avenula swards which is subject to its own distinctive successional changes. In King's studies, the most characteristic species of the ant-hills were of two kinds: those within the immediately sur rounding sward which were more readily able to grow through or on to the accumulating soil (notably the chamaephytes Thymus praecox, Helianthemum nummularium, Cerastium fontanum and, to a lesser extent, Asperula cynanchica) and therophytes, virtually absent from the intact grassland but able to find a very congenial germination ground on the mounds (Arenaria ser-pyllifolia, Veronica arvensis). With ageing, but continued occupation, the vegetation seemed to stabilise with large amounts of T. praecox and H. nummularium but, on abandonment, other species, especially Hieracium pilosella, became conspicuous to form vegetation which appears to resemble that of the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland. Although hills produced by moles (Talpa europaea) are frequent in Festuca-Avenula grassland and may be confused with ant-hills (see King 1977a), they present a somewhat different disruption of the surface and show a less peculiar flora. Mole-holes are rapidly excavated in a single operation and are quickly eroded by rain and trampling by stock to ground-level. Their soil is not structurally sorted, being simply a disturbed pile of material, and it may contain seeds and vegetative frag ments which can readily regenerate (King 1977a). Though there may be a temporary flush of therophytes on the mound, the vegetation seems quickly to return to that of the surrounding grassland. The aesthetic appeal of Festuca-Avenula swards has long made them popular for recreation which can entail heavy trampling and sometimes the driving or parking of vehicles on the vegetation. Around picnic spots, there may also be particular kinds of cultural eutrophication. In recent years, a declining number of stands has come under increasing pressure from a growing and more mobile population and some sites, as on the North Downs (Streeter 1971, Dixon 1973) or along the north Wales coast (Rodwell 1974), have become especially vulnerable. The distinctive springy turf of the community seems https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.021 Published online by Cambridge University Press156 Calcicolous grasslands resilient to a certain amount of trampling but, where this is concentrated, as along paths and around viewingpoints, clear changes occur in the vegetation. In such places, there is often a local increase in resistant grasses, notably Cynosurus cristatus, but in some cases also Dactylis glomerata, Agrostis stolonifera and Holcus lanatus, and in some of the rosette species, such as Plantago lanceolata, Bellis perennis and Taraxacum officinale agg., at the expense of more sensitive plants like the chamaephytes. This gives such swards a somewhat similar composition to the Holcus-Trifolium sub community and recreational trampling may play a part in the development of some stands of this kind of Festuca-Avenula grassland. Typically, however, the sward lacks the tussocky physiognomy of this vege tation, being extremely short. Also, the further appearance in the turf of Lolium perenne, especially where there is some eutrophication, often presages a rapid move towards Lolio-Plantaginion vegetation. Very similar changes to these were observed by Perring (1967) with an increase in horse-galloping pressure on stretches of Newmarket Heath, Suffolk, used for race-horse exercising. Most unusually among Festuca-Avenula species, the rarity Pulsatilla vulgaris is actually benefited by heavy trampling, which stimulates the formation of new rosettes from deep adventitious root-buds (Wells & Barling 1971). Even where this species is present, how ever, very heavy pressure may eventually disrupt the sward, allow soil erosion and expose the bedrock. Distribution "
"cg3","Zonation and succession Zonations involving the Bromus grassland are most often reflections of serai changes related to the intensity of grazing and sometimes complicated histories of ploughing and abandonment. Occasionally, the community may show an abrupt transition to disturbed, oligotrophic soils that cannot, apparently, be invaded by B. erectus (Lloyd 1964, Lloyd & Pigott 1967). More usually, it occurs in irregular patchworks with surviving areas of Festuca-Avenula grassland, other rank swards that have developed with a demise of grazing (e.g. the Brachypodium pinnatum and Avenula pubescens grasslands) and scrub. Such patterns have been described in detail from Lullington Heath in Sussex (Grubb et al. 1969) , Barton Hills in Bedfordshire (Wells & Morris 1970) and Porton Down (Wells et al. 1976) and they are a common feature of many areas of the southern Chalk and Oolite (e.g. Ratcliffe 1977). In principle, the fact that B. erectus will be eaten by stock and rabbits means that its expansion in swards is reversible with a resumption of grazing (Hope-Simpson 1940Z?). In practice, this may be more complicated. For example, Wells (1971) showed how B. erectus maintained its cover in this kind of vegetation over shallow, rendziniform soils with quite heavy grazing, even increasing in extent on deeper loamy soils. It is therefore possible that swards may stabilise with a higher B. erectus cover and that really hard grazing, with no alternative, more palatable herbage, is necessary to effect any marked reduction. The high cost of this kind of pastoral control has focused attention on mowing as an alternative means of retaining or recovering the species-richness and diversity of those calcicolous swards where B. erectus can gain a hold. Wells (1971) demonstrated that cutting in spring, shortly after growth commenced in March, was effective in holding steady or reducing the cover of B. erectus, perhaps by depleting the newly-mobilised food reserves. Regrowth was then poor and other species were able to capitalise on the provision of space. Summer cutting sometimes encouraged the expansion of B. erectus, perhaps because of stimulating the production of tillers when growth was in full swing. Though mowing is unselective (and not always practical on very steep slopes), it can be precisely timed and this may have advantages in allowing selected species to flower and set seed (e.g. Wells 1969, 1971, 1973). Burning, though it has been more traditionally prac tised on grasslands with Brachypodium pinnatum, has sometimes been used as a means of controlling B. erectus which, in dry weather, is readily ignited with its accumulations of litter. It may not always be successful. Indeed, it may stimulate fresh growth in the cleaned sward and, though new shoots may be more eagerly eaten by stock, without grazing the B. erectus may simply resume its dominance. The subsequent successional development of Bromus grassland with the continued absence of grazing has never been followed in detail. Though stands of the community often occur in close association with scrub, we do not know how readily shrubs and trees can invade the ranker swards. Certainly, some stands, after rapid establishment following myxomatosis, seem to have https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.022 Published online by Cambridge University PressCG3 Bromus erectus grassland 169 remained substantially unchanged for 30 years. Large populations of field voles (Microtus agrestis) often become established in such litter-choked tussocky grasslands and these may play an important role in eating and barking seedlings of woody species (Smith 1980). Deli berate or accidental burning may also repeatedly set back any invasion and help maintain the vegetation as a plagioclimax. Where colonisation by B. erectus is more gradual or patchy, it is possible that shrubs and trees may become established in the more open turf or on ant hills which are often abandoned as they become increasingly shaded by the tall grasses (Wells et al. 1976, King 1977c). Distribution "
"cg4","Zonation and succession The various kinds of Brachypodium grassland, like those dominated by Bromus erectus, commonly occur in zonations which reflect serai changes related to grazing intensity, forming patchworks with Festuca-Avenula grassland, other rank swards and scrub as on the Wye and Crundale Downs in Kent (Green 1973), at Castor Hanglands on the Huntingdon/Peterborough Oolite (Duffey et al. 1974) and over the Chalk of the Yorkshire Wolds (NCC Yorkshire Chalk Grassland Survey 1985). More locally, the community occurs with more open weed vegetation and scrub on quarry spoil (e.g. Shimwell 1968«). Because of its unpalatability, the expansion of B. pinnatum seems to be reversible only with difficulty. Grazing with sheep alone, especially just in winter, is ineffective and even all year round grazing involving https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press178 Calcicolous grasslands cattle may do no more than simply restrict further spread and reduce the pronounced tussocky character of the sward (Hope-Simpson 1940Z), Green 1973). Likewise, burning alone, though cheaper than grazing, des troys accumulated litter but may not reduce the cover of B. pinnatum'. indeed, it can encourage further expansion, though twice-yearly burns in alternate years may prevent this (Green 1973). More effective seem to be combinations of these treatments, for example a burn in very early spring followed by very hard grazing, preferably by cattle first, then sheep (Hope-Simpson 19406, Green 1973). Sprinkling salt on the tussocks may encourage stock to eat the herbage (Hope-Simpson 19406). The assiduous care needed in such treatments to avoid deleterious side effects such as poaching of the soil, always a danger where cattle are grazing steeper slopes, or loss of invertebrate populations with burning, and the difficulties of integrating them with recreational use of the grasslands, makes mowing an attractive alternative. Mowing with removal of the cuttings has been shown to be effective in maintaining less tussocky and more varied Brachypodium swards and reduction in the height of the herbage may induce rabbits to graze (Green 1973). The further development of ungrazed Brachypodium grasslands has not been monitored in detail. As with Bromus erectus, the dense tussocky nature of some of the swards and the high population of voles which this encourages, may hinder scrub invasion. Though B. pinnatum is actually palatable to Microtus agrestis (Godfrey 1953, 1955, Chitty et al. 1968), it is doubtful whether voles make great inroads on the cover of the species. Distribution "
"cg5","Zonation and succession As with other lowland calcicolous grasslands, stands of the community are now very much restricted to slopes or abandoned quarries isolated within landscapes devoted largely to arable farming. On such sites, zonations are usually a reflection of serai progressions related to the intensity of grazing and/or burning. Over scarp slopes, the community occurs in patchworks with Festuca-Avenula grassland (usually of restricted occurrence over the Oolite), other rank swards dominated by B. erectus or B. pinnatum alone, scrub and woodland. In old quarries, zonations may involve more open weed vege tation on young or recently-disturbed spoil and rock faces. The details of serai changes involving this vegetation type have never been studied. It seems likely that, in quarries, the Hieracium sub-community could progress to the Typical sub-community with colonisation of exposed surfaces and that either sub-community, perhaps especially the more open Hieracium vegetation, is prone to invasion by shrubs and trees. Continued burning and grazing can, however, maintain the community as a plagioclimax and some of the more extensive stands occur on commons where public demands and/or ownership by conservation agencies provide incentives to their continued maintenance as open spaces. Distribution "
"cg6","Zonation and succession Despite the widespread decline in pasturing over the lowland limestones, large stands of the community are rare because the bulk of the most suitable soils has passed into arable cultivation. Where it does occur, this vegetation usually forms part of zonations which are both related to edaphic variation but also a reflection of serai changes mediated by grazing. The Dactylis-Briza sub-community is typically found as a narrow, patchy fringe towards the bottom of valleyside slopes or as small, isolated stands on local accumulations of colluvium or head. As the soil cover thins to more shallow, dry and oligotrophic rendzinas, it grades to more calcicolous swards. For the most part, these are various kinds of Festuca-Avenula grassland though, on the Durham Magnesian Limestone, this sub-community may pass to Sesleria-Scabiosa grassland. The more extensive stands of the Potentilla-Tragopogon sub-community at Porton occur in analogous edaphically-related zonations, grading to Festuca-Avenula swards over shallower rendzinas and on the sorted soils of occupied ant-hills. Over very oligotrophic, flint-strewn soils, especially where there has been a history of rabbit-warrening, the sub-community gives way to the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland. The most likely immediate serai precursors of the https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.025 Published online by Cambridge University Press190 Calcicolous grasslands Avenulapubescens grassland are perhaps the more mesotrophic Festuca-Avenula swards, like those in the Hol cus-Trifolium and Succisa-Leucanthemum sub-communities. In more calcicolous vegetation, ant-hills may provide nuclei from which the ranker grasses can spread. Once established, the Avenula pubescens grassland can probably progress to scrub provided the sward is not so overwhelmingly dominated by a mattress-like or tus socky cover of grasses as to leave no space for seedlings to gain a hold. The less rank vegetation of the Dactylis-Briza sub-community is more likely to be invaded and species like Crataegus monogyna and Prunus spinosa sometimes gain a vigorous hold in its deep, moist soils and from there slowly advance up valley sides. Rabbits may play some part in keeping the vegetation of the Potentilla-Tragopogon sub-community in check but, even without any grazing, it seems doubtful whether the very rank swards here can be easily invaded by shrubs. They may therefore maintain themselves for very long periods with, perhaps, some measure of cyclical change as tussocks decay and the weeds come and go. At Swyncombe, Smith et a/. (1971) noted that, if Urtica dioica gained a hold on bare patches, it precipitated a very rapid breakdown of grass litter which opened the way for colonisation by more extensive areas of weed vegetation. Distribution "
"cg7","Zonation and succession Zonations between the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland and other vegetation types generally reflect edaphic gradients or serai changes mediated by grazing. Most frequently, in soil-related sequences, the community represents the most oligotrophic extreme of a range of calcicolous communities, giving way, with varying degrees of abruptness, to more closed and mesophytic swards, over deeper, moister and richer soils. The Koeleria sub-community is the usual kind of Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland encountered in such zonations and, in moving away from the rocky knolls, cliff tops, fine talus or rock waste on which it typically occurs, it thickens up, generally to some type of Festuca-Avenula grassland or, where grazing has been relaxed, to ranker swards dominated by coarse calcicolous grasses. At Porton Down, the Cladonia sub community occurs in comparable mosaics with the Festuca-Avenula grassland, picking out patches of the poorest and most chalky and flint-strewn soils (Wells et al. 1976). Such zonations can be gradual, the deepening of the soil being reflected in a hazy shift from chamaephytes, therophytes and bryophytes (and lichens in the Cladonia sub-community) to grasses and hemicryptophytes. However, where soil impoverishment has been produced by gross disturbance, such as ploughing, vegetation boundaries are characteristically sharp: stands of the Fragaria-Erigeron sub-community, for example, can pick out the shape of an arable field long after its abandonment, passing abruptly at its margins to the usually rank swards of adjacent neglected pastures (e.g. Cornish 1954, Lloyd 1964, Lloyd & Pigott 1967). Similarly stark patterns characterise the occurrence of Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland (usually the Koe leria sub-community) on the continually-disturbed soils of occupied ant-hills (King 1977a, b). More unusually, though much more famously, the https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.026 Published online by Cambridge University PressCG7 Festuca ovina-Hieraciumpilosella-Thymus praecox! pulegioides grassland 203 community represents the most calcicolous extreme of a spectrum of oligotrophic communities, passing, over deeper and more acidic soils, to calcifugous grasslands and heaths. This is the kind of sequence first fully described by Watt (1936, 1940) from Breckland where both the Ditrichum-Diploschistes and Cladonia sub communities occur as part of the range of his 'grassheaths'. The former type of Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland is very much confined to the most exposed and inhospitable, flinty rendzinas, being replaced over slightly deeper and less calcareous, though still base rich, soils by the latter sub-community. This, in turn, gives way, over sandy brown earths, to Festuca-Agros-tis-Rumex grassland as calcicoles are eclipsed by calcifuges and the grass cover thickens up somewhat but, in the harsh continental climate and with (at the time of Watt's survey) continued heavy rabbit-grazing and mole-disturbance, the general contribution made to the vegetation by therophytes, bryophytes and lichens remains important. As Watt stressed, the actual manifestations of this sequence, and its continuation into very calcifuge vegetation over podzols, are complex and often incomplete at a single site. Moreover, even the most intact of these zonations are now much altered because of the reduction in rabbit-grazing. However, it is clear that the various kinds of Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland respond rather differently to the cessation of grazing. In the more extreme types of sward, such as those of the Ditrichum-Diploschistes sub community, edaphic and climatic conditions are so harsh as to prevent the speedy development of a more intact and mesotrophic vegetation upon enclosure (Watt 1962, 1981 tz, b). Some stands of the Koeleria sub community, such as those over very rocky cliff tops, are probably similarly uncongenial to the spread of grasses and the appearance of hemicryptophytes. In other cases, as with the Fragaria-Eriger on sub-community, artificially enhanced oligotrophy seems to be so severe as to impede the formation of a more grassy sward (Lloyd 1964, Lloyd & Pigott 1967). With these vegetation types, the stabilisation of the soil surface and the accumulation of fertility is likely to be a very slow process (Watt 1981/)). The Cladonia sub-community, on the other hand, shows much more pronounced and rapid changes with enclosure, so that the vegetation comes to resemble something akin to a Festuca-Avenula sward (Watt 1957, 1962). At Porton, too, Wells et al. (1976) suggested that this might be the fate of ungrazed stands of the Cladonia sub-community. But such resemblances are likely to be temporary, because the Festuca-Avenula grassland is also dependent on grazing for its maintenance and, among herbaceous species, it is perhaps the ranker grasses which are the likelier candidates as eventual dominants after long enclosure or abandonment. Here, too, though, there may be complexities: Bromus erectus, for example, in many ways eminently suited to these more oligotrophic, calcareous soils, seems strikingly slow to invade them, perhaps because of its poor dispersal (Watt 1957, 1962, Lloyd 1964, Lloyd & Pigott 1967). Avenula pratensis may likewise be inhibited from spreading for a number of reasons not directly related to the poor nutrient content of the soils (Wells et al. 1976). Other possible colonisers, such as Avenula pubescens and Festuca rubra, though they can gain an initial hold on abandoned ant-hills, may need a considerable accumulation of fertility before they can spread extensively (Wells et al. 1976, King 1977 a, c). Even where changes in the herbaceous vegetation are fairly rapid and considerable, evidence suggests that, in some cases, they are likely to be overtaken by the invasion of those woody species which can establish themselves directly in the open and inhospitable con ditions. At Lloyd's Pulpit Hill Field site, for example, Cornus sanguinea was noticeably common among the Fragaria-Eriger on vegetation and he suggested that a number of features gave it an advantage over Crataegus monogyna, a very abundant early invader of Festuca-Avenula swards: high percentage viability and quick germination of the seed, indeterminate shoot growth and the ability to sucker and spread vegetatively once established (Lloyd 1964, Lloyd & Pigott 1967). C. sanguinea also occurred at Porton though, here, Juniper-us communis ssp. communis was an important coloniser of swards of the Cladonia sub-community after myxomatosis, forming open scrub (Wells et al. 1976). In Breckland, Pinus sylvestris is the most prominent woody species, seeding in from the extensive plantations nearby, and even the Ditrichum-Diploschistes vegetation would seem to be progressing to open pinewood (Watt 1957, 1962, 1974, 1981 a). Distribution "
"cg8","Zonation and succession Since most remaining tracts of the community occur within enclosures sandwiched between plateau and vale agricultural land, natural zonations to other vegetation types developed in relation to soil sequences over the scarp are rare. In a few places, however, the Carlina-Hypericum sub-community can be seen grading through the Avenula sub-community to rank, mesotrophic swards over slope-foot colluvium. https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.027 Published online by Cambridge University Press214 Calcicolous grasslands More often, however, the community occurs in mosaics with open vegetation, rough grasslands and scrub which reflect serai progressions mediated by soil development and the amount of grazing. Colonisation of artificial habitats, such as quarry floors, ledges and spoil begins with the appearance of rank weeds such as Epilobium angustifolium, Hypericum spp. and Erigeron acer and, in damper places, patches of acrocarpous mosses (Shimwell 1968«, 1971/?) and proceeds to the more stable vegetation of the Hieracium sub-community. Where grazing is absent, this can probably be quickly invaded by shrubs and trees but, where stock or rabbits have access and there is deeper accumulation of soil, it is possible that it develops into the Carlina-Hypericum sub-community. With light grazing, the tus socky swards of the A venula sub-community may supervene and develop into patchy scrub with Avenulapubescens grassland or Arrhenatheretum between. The commonest scrub species in the area are Crataegus monogyna, Prunus spinosa, Ulex europaeus and Rosa spp. and the natural progression would be to the Geranium sub-community of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland, stands of which occur in close association with Sesleria-Scabiosa grassland. In damper situations, Salix spp. may appear as early woody colonisers. Distribution "
"cg9","Zonation and succession Vegetation sequences involving the Sesleria-Galium grassland are generally related to edaphic transitions or, with some sub-communities, are a reflection of serai changes mediated by grazing. Two kinds of soil-related zonations are especially noteworthy. First, the community often forms part of a range of vegetation types which run from fragmentary communities over crevice protorendzinas on very rocky https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.028 Published online by Cambridge University Press226 Calcicolous grasslands topographies to calcifugous grasslands and heaths over deeper, drift-contaminated brown earths. Such patterns are especially well seen on the characteristic benches which alternate with cliffs on the valley sides of the Craven dales (Rodwell 1974) but they occur widely in more fragmentary form wherever there is heterogeneity in the soil cover over the limestone. In some cases, as on the warm and dry edges of exposures around Morecambe Bay, it is the Helianthemum-Asperula sub community of the Sesleria-Galium grassland itself which occurs as the most open vegetation type, giving way, further back from the cliff edges to the Typical sub community as the soil cover deepens and becomes more extensive. Inland, where the climate is cooler and damper, the Typical sub-community usually gives way, over cliff crevices and on small ledges, to some kind of fern-dominated vegetation, either Asplenion communities or, especially on screes and in deeper crevices, to stands of Gymnocarpium robertianum. In other cases, transitions to screes are marked by a gradation to various mixtures of Arrhenatherum elatius, Geranium robertianum, Brachypodium sylvaticum and Mercurialis perennis. Over pavements, fragments of the Typical sub community, or of the Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea sub-community where it occurs in solution hollows, may give way sharply to grike vegetation of which various species of the Sesleria-Galium grassland can make up an important component. On the deeper soils in such sequences, typically found some way back from cliff edges or over infilled, con cealed grikes, there is almost always some loess or boulder clay. Here, the Typical sub-community gives way, with a sharpness that is often a direct reflection of the distance to the underlying limestone or the extent of contamination of the soils with superficials, to some kind of Nardo-Galion sward, sometimes with an interposed band of the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland in which there is a gradual shift from calcicoles to calcifuges as the dominant element in the vegetation. In the drier parts of the range of the community, as over the Morecambe Bay limestones, the sequence may continue to Calluna-Erica heath over acid but still fairly dry and light-textured soils. Where there is a complex patchwork of different soils over often very uneven bedrock sur faces, these different vegetation types may occur in close proximity, forming the intimate mixtures sometimes described as 'limestone heaths (e.g. Moss 1911, Dixon 1982). Inland and at higher altitudes, this latter part of such sequences shows a shift towards vegetation types characteristic of moister soils. The Typical sub community may be replaced here by the Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea sub-community which may pass to Nar-dus-Galium or Juncus-Festuca grasslands and then to Erico-Sphagnion ombrogenous mire. In the peculiarly extreme conditions in Upper Teesdale, such zonations tend to be telescoped so that the Carex-Kobresia sub community is restricted to 'windows' within an expanse of wet heath and bog (Bradshaw & Jones 1976). The second kind of edaphically-related zonation is less common, though very distinctive. It occurs wherever there is some soligenous flushing of these grasslands, as when water percolating through the limestone hits some interbedded and less permeable stratum. In such situations, the Typical sub-community of the sur rounding slopes gives way, sometimes through a zone of the Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea sub-community, to a Caricion davallianae mire, usually of small extent. At lower altitudes, this latter vegetation is usually the Briza-Primula sub-community of the Pinguiculo-Caricetum but, in Upper Teesdale, the Carex-Juncus sub-community can figure in these sequences or, on gravelly areas near to the flush heads, the Gymnostomum sub-community. The subtle patterns which these vege tation types form, and their susceptibility to disturbance, makes them a very precious component of the upland limestone landscape. Other, less frequent, zonations involve transitions to mesotrophic grassland over deeper, moister but still moderately calcareous soils. The typical situation for such floristic shifts is towards the bottom of scree slopes where there is an accumulation of colluvium, but these are frequently obscured by the enclosure and agricultural improvement of the swards. On rare occasions, however, there may be gradations to unimproved mea dow communities like the Centaureo-Cynosuretum or, in dale heads at higher altitudes, the Anthoxanthum-Geranium grassland. In a very few localities, the Sesleria-Galium grassland passes to the Filipendulo-Arrhenatheretum on north-facing slopes where, towards the foot of cliffs, there is an absence of grazing. Although scattered wind-cut trees, such as Taxus baccata, Fraxinus excelsior and, in some sites, the endemic Sorbus lancastriensis, are a distinctive feature of crevices in the cliffs over which the Helianthemum-Asperula sub-community occurs (Proctor 1958, Clapham & Nicholson 1975), this kind of Sesleria-Galium grassland and the two montane sub-communities can be seen as climatic climax vegetation types from which the withdrawal of grazing would probably have little effect. With the Typical and Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea sub-communities, on the other hand, the soils are neither too dry nor too wet, and the climate insufficiently cold, to prevent the invasion of woody species. Stands which are inaccessible to stock show a marked increase in the grass cover, especially of S. albicans which can form virtually pure clumps but, though this species and many of the associates can persist for some time under a light woody canopy, these sub-communities are eventually replaced by scrub when grazing is https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.028 Published online by Cambridge University PressCG9 Sesleria albicans-Galium sterneri grassland 227 withdrawn. Succession has never been followed in detail but the most likely invaders would seem to be Crataegus monogyna, Prunus spinosa, Corylus avellana, Sorbus aucuparia, Fraxinus excelsior and Taxus baccata with, on drier sites, Betula pendula and, over more mesotrophic soils, Acer pseudoplat anus and Ulmus glabra. Mix tures of these species commonly occur as dense thickets on scree slopes which are ungrazed and they can expand out from grikes on inaccessible stretches of pavement. On drier and warmer slopes, the succession can be to Fraxinus-Acer-Mer cur ialis woodland but Acer cam-pestre itself, and two common invaders of grasslands on Carboniferous Limestone further south, Cornus sanguinea and Rhamnus catharticus, are very much towards their northern limit in this area and are only sparsely seen in developing or mature woodlands. On moister and cooler slopes, the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mer cur ialis woodland, the climax community on base-rich soils in the north and west of Britain, may be a more likely development. Distribution "
"h1","Zonation and succession The Calluna-Festuca heath is found with a variety of other vegetation types in zonations and mosaics which reflect patterns of edaphic variation and long and diverse treatment histories. Very often now, the neglect of traditional styles of heathland management has blurred the boundaries in such sequences and allowed serai developments previously held in check. More drastic heathland improvement has truncated and frag mented many zonations and stands of the community are frequently abruptly marked off from surrounding arable land or coniferous plantations. Even the relatively small surviving tracts of heathland in eastern England sometimes stretch over a range of soil parent materials, with either sequences of diverse solid deposits or, very often, a cover of heterogeneous drift, variable in thickness, and thus in the extent to which it masks the influence of the underlying bedrock, and in its own chemical and physical characteristics. The soil mantle is therefore often quite varied, with profiles differing in such features as base-richness, texture and permeability, even within a small compass (e.g. Watt 1936, 1940, Corbett 1973, Hodge et al. 1984). Over such sequences of soils, the Calluna-Festuca heath has become established on the more acidic and free-draining, accentuating the tendency towards podzolisation and often marked off from neighbouring vegetation types by shifts in one or more of these edaphic factors. In a few localities, soil moisture is a controlling variable, the community representing the dry-heath element in the kind of pattern so characteristic of the surrounds to southern valley mires (e.g. Rose 1953), where there is a zonation through wet heath to mire vegetation in relation to a locally high ground watertable. On some of the west Norfolk commons, at Sandringham Warren and Roydon Common, for example (Daniels & Pearson 1974, Ratcliffe 1977), the Calluna-Festuca heath occupies some of the driest of the sequence of acidic soils, passing on seasonally-waterlogged mineral profiles to the Ericetum tetralicis, which then gives way to a variety of mire communities, depending on the base-richness of the ground waters. Although Calluna maintains its frequency within the Ericetum, its vigour is usually depressed and the boundary between the two kinds of heath is generally well marked by the confinement of Erica tetralix and Molinia to the wetter ground, a restriction which reflects the continental character of the climate. Within the range of the Calluna-Festuca heath, zonations of this kind are less common than in central southern and south-west Britain and more often the prevailing kind of edaphic variation over the tracts of heathland here is in base-richness among profiles which are more or less uniformly free-draining. Such differences depend upon variations in the amount of calcareous material in the superficials and the proximity to the surface of any limy bedrocks, most importantly through much of East Anglia, the Chalk, and they are particularly influential in the Breckland mosaics of heath and grassland renowned from Watt's (1936,1940) accounts. Such patterns, still to be seen in whole or part on the remaining fragments of the Stanford-Wretham, Ick-lingham and Lakenheath-Elveden heaths (Ratcliffe 1977), involve transitions from the Calluna-Festuca heath, through calcifuge Nardo-Galion swards, to the Festuca-Avenula and Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grasslands, with an edaphic shift from Worlington brown sands with some podzolisation, through Methwold brown calcareous sands, to Newmarket brown rendzinas (Corbett 1973, Hodge et al. 1984). Floristic variation within the sequence is more or less continuous and, though the limit of the heath is well marked by the bounds of the dominant Calluna, fine mosaics of the community with patches of included grassland are common (though they lose much of their clarity if grazing is relaxed: see below). The degree of order within these soil and vegetation mosaics is, in fact, very vari https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.045 Published online by Cambridge University PressHl Calluna vulgaris-Festuca ovina heath 377 able, dependent as it is on the great heterogeneity of the cover of superficials, but some especially striking pat terns have resulted where the materials have undergone periglacial sorting to produce such features as polygons or stripes. These occur quite widely over the gently-undulating landscape of East Anglia and are often very clearly delineated on unimproved land, because the Calluna-Festuca heath typically picks out the areas of deeper and more acidic sandy infill, while the polygon centres or areas between the stripes are occupied by the grasslands (Williams 1964, Corbett 1973, Curtis et al. 1976) . Especially good examples of the striped kind of patterning can be seen at Eriswell High Warren, on Thetford Heath and around Grimes Graves (Ratcliffe 1977) . Two other kinds of floristic variation can confuse these soil-related patterns. These, too, have some kind of edaphic basis but they are also a reflection of competitive interactions between Calluna and two other possible dominants, Pteridium and Carex arenaria, on the dry acidic soils which the community favours, so the spatial patterns that result are often but a temporary indication of shifting successional developments. Pteridium is generally confined to deeper soils, free from parching, but toing and froing of dominance between it and Calluna is in large measure dependent upon coincidence of a vigorous, expansive phase in the one with a declining, weakly-competitive phase in the other (Watt 1955), a pattern of growth which is endogenous, though strongly influenced by external biotic or climatic factors (Watt 1971, Marrs 1986). This is why mosaics between the Calluna-Festuca heath and the Pteridum-Galium community are so diverse on the ground and variable through time. Zonations to the Carex arenaria or Carex-Cladonia dune communities are likewise related to com petition between heather and the sedge, though the greater tolerance of the latter to shifting sand often means that transitions from one vegetation type to the other reflect present or past instability of the sandy soil surface (Watt 1937). Patchworks of grassland, heath, bracken and sandsedge compose the characteristic vegetation cover of the heathlands of eastern England and were in the past maintained by the traditional burning and grazing treatments, with rabbits, long encouraged in the warrens of this region, providing a very important additional graz ing component. The burning renewed the heather at regular intervals, probably helped keep bracken in check and repeatedly set back any invasion of shrubs or trees; the grazing helped maintain the grassland against expansion of the heath, sharpening up the boundaries between them. The abandonment of these treatments and the demise of rabbits in the myxomatosis epidemic have allowed the grasslands and the heather to grow rank in many places, so that transitions between the communities have been obscured. They have also permitted serai progressions to scrub and woodland, patches of which, sometimes very dense and extensive, have become common on these heathlands. The most important woody invaders on the dry, acidic soils characterised by the Calluna-Festuca heath are Betula pen dula and the pines, of which there are now such abundant seed-parents in the plantations. Oak, often Quercus robur over the range of the community, sometimes figures if there are mature trees fairly close at hand and locally Rhododendronponticum has become common, as at Sandringham Warren, for example. Colonisation of vigorous, dense Calluna by these species, particularly birch and pine, is very difficult but degenerate heather, experiencing no burning or grazing, offers ample open ground. Once well established, such trees can shade out the heather and most of its heathland associates and come to dominate in Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland, the climax forest of base-poor, free-draining soils in lowland Britain. Natural gaps or cleared areas within such woodland can show a temporary resurgence of the heath, though there is a strong tendency for the Pteridium-Galium community to become ensconced in such places or for Ulex-Rubus scrub to develop in disturbed areas. Gorse scrub of this kind is also sometimes found around coniferous plantations and often runs across the heathland in strips marking out the edges of trackways. Distribution "
"h10","Zonation and succession The community is typically found with grasslands, other kinds of heath and mires in zonations and mosaics where floristic variation is determined by differences in soils, local climate and treatments. Stable regimes of burning and grazing can hold any successional developments in check but, without some kind of treatment, many stands would probably progress to scrub and woodland. In the simplest edaphic sequences, the Calluna-Erica heath occurs over the driest in series of base-poor soils disposed over the hill-slopes of the upland fringes. In those more oceanic parts of northern Britain where it is concentrated, it typically gives way, over gley-podzols and stagnopodzols which can accumulate a thick humic top over the periodically waterlogged sub-soil, to the Scirpus-Erica wet heath. There Calluna retains its high frequency, but E. cinerea is usually replaced by E. tetralix, and Molinia and Scirpus cespitosus become very common and often abundant, with more or less total eclipse of the smaller grasses and a replacement of the pleurocarpous mosses by at least some Sphagna. Such transitions are usually seen over ground of decreasing slope, either moving down from hillsides with shedding drainage on to more gentle receiving ground or uphill on to plateaus with intergrades to ombrogenous peat, but they can be very gradual and, where discontinuous mantles of drift result in patchy variations of drainage impedence, intimate mosaics of the two vegetation types can be seen, even over gently-undulating or flat ground. In such patterns as these, Typical Calluna-Erica heath is often found grading into Typical Scirpus-Erica heath or, in more exposed situations or where the ground has been much degraded, the Racomitrium sub-community can be seen juxtaposed with the Cladonia sub-community of the Scirpus-Erica heath. Quite widely, too, the zonation runs on into the Scirpus-Eriophorum blanket mire over thickening ombrogenous peat. The proportion of these communities in the sequences varies with the rainfall because, with the shift into the wetter reaches of northwest Scotland, the wet heath and blanket mire spread on to ground of increasing slope, thus restricting the contribution of the dry heath. Drainage of the peat can reverse this trend and the spread of E. cinerea through the wet heath and on into the Cladonia sub-community of the blanket mire in the more oceanic parts of Britain, as in the Outer Hebrides (Hulme & Blyth 1984) and Shetland (Hulme 1985, Roper-Lindsay & Say 1986), is a striking indication of the shift of the vegetation towards the Calluna-Erica heath where the bogs have been much cut over. Analagous sequences to the above can also be seen where the community extends into eastern Scotland, though here the wet heath is usually represented by the Ericetum tetralicis and the blanket bog by the Calluna-Eriophorum mire. More often, though, in these latter zonations, the Calluna-Erica heath is itself replaced by the Calluna-Vaccinium heath, producing a boreal equivalent to the kinds of patterns normally seen in the oceanic west. However, as explained earlier, the two heath types do show some geographical overlap, when they are sometimes separated altitudinally, the Calluna-Vaccinium heath replacing the Calluna-Erica type with the move to higher ground, or according to aspect, when the com munities can be found in closer proximity, but with the Calluna-Vaccinium heath taking over with the shift on to slopes facing north and east. Other local climatic com plications can be seen among the dry-heath components of these kinds of sequences where sub-shrub vegetation runs right to the edge of sea-cliffs receiving appreciable https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.054 Published online by Cambridge University PressH10 Calluna vulgaris-Erica cinerea heath 477 amounts of salt-spray. In extreme cases the Calluna-Erica heath can be totally replaced by some kind of Calluna-Scilla heath, but the two communities sometimes occur together, zoned according to the gradient of spray deposition and showing great continuity in their sub-shrub components, the effect of maritime influence being mainly felt among the associated herb flora, the particular character of which is also influenced by the nature of the soil. Such patterns are well seen on Skye (Birks 1973), along the Caithness cliffs and in Shetland (Birse 1980, Roper-Lindsay & Say 1986), where the Festuca-Anthoxanthum sub-community and, on more base-rich soils, the Thymus-Carex type, grade to the maritime heath. Analagous patterns occur towards the back of some coastal dune-systems, where the Calluna-Erica heath grades to Calluna-Carex heath towards the sea. Zonations of these kinds, influenced primarily by differences in soils or climate or both, are all very often affected by treatments. In particular, burning, with its general tendency to favour vigorous regrowth of heather over the medium term, can blur boundaries between the Calluna-Erica heath and either the Scirpus-Erica wet heath or other types of drier sub-shrub vegetation, maritime or not, which occur adjacent to it, and it may take a considerable period of time before the floristic differences between the communities grow out to re assert the zonation that has been cut across by fire. Grazing, too, can confuse patterns by, for example, favouring an abundance of herbaceous associates that are shared by the different kinds of heath: Molinia can increase generally across the junction of the Calluna-Erica heath and the Scirpus-Erica wet heath and, in transitions to maritime sub-shrub vegetation, finer-leaved grasses and small herbs may be encouraged throughout, producing a general grassy appearance that masks the increasing influence of salt-spray. More generally important, however, is the effect which grazing, either alone or in conjunction with burning, has on mediating the transformation of this kind of heath to Nardo-Galion grasslands. After fire, very heavy grazing can precipitate a run-down of the heath to swards in which Nardus stricta or Juncus squarrosus play an important part or permit the spread of Pteridium aquilinum. But, less catastrophically than this, steady grazing pressure pushes the vegetation to wards the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland or, over more base-rich soils, the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland. The Festuca-Anthoxanthum and Thymus-Carex sub-communities are essentially intermediates along this developmental line and are very often found intermixed with the Nardo-Galion swards in mosaics which are determined by differences in grazing intensity. Many of these mixtures are stable and there is some pastoral advantage in having patches of the heath, which can provide a valuable winter bite, among the more generally nutritious grassland, but the long continuance of heavy pasturing, in areas like south-west Scotland, has certainly reduced the proportion of heaths in the mosaics (e.g. Hill & Evans 1978). Release from grazing and burning, except where the heath occurs in very exposed situations, theoretically permits progression to scrub and woodland though, in many areas, natural seed-parents are now scarce. Over the characteristic soils here, the most likely developments are the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland or, where the profiles are not quite so base-poor and oligotrophic, the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland, with in both cases birch, mostly Betula pubescens, rather than oak being very much the predominant tree. Where the community extends into east-central Scotland, the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland is a possible climax of successions involving the Calluna-Erica heath, with the Juniperus-Oxalis scrub perhaps figuring as a precursor (Birse 1980). In various parts of the range, but particularly in the Dumfries and Galloway hills, ground which would be at least partly occupied by the community has been extensively afforested and conifers from the plantations can seed into the heath. Distribution "
"h11","Zonation and succession The Calluna-Carex heath is a local element of zonations and mosaics on older stretches of coastal dunes and sand plain, grading to grasslands or various kinds of C. arenaria or Ammophila vegetation, or to scrub, woodland and bracken, in patterns which reflect the progression of the dune sere, differences in the character of the soils and the influence of past and present treatments. In most cases, the community would probably progress readily to scrub and woodland with relief from grazing, provided seed-parents of suitable shrubs and trees were available. The most striking complex of vegetation types among which the Calluna-Carex heath can be found involves the more calcifuge of the swards characteristic of stable dune sands. Quite often, it occurs within stretches of the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grassland, typically a short turf dominated by mixtures of C. arenaria, F. ovina, F. rubra, A. capillaris and Poa pratensis with Anthoxanthum and L. campestris occurring on the more impoverished sub strates, and scattered plants of G. saxatile, G. verum and L. corniculatus. Such vegetation can pass imperceptibly into the grassy ground of more open tracts of the Calluna-Carex heath, the major difference between the communities being the presence of sub-shrubs. Generally speaking, the distribution of these presents a sharp boundary: occasional bushes are sometimes to be seen isolated among more extensive stretches of grassland, but there is rarely that gentle gradation of size and age among the bushes that denotes a continuous process of invasion. More usually, it looks as if the patterns reflect past colonisation events, with the grassland/heath tran sitions often subsequently sharpened up by renewed grazing. Bryophytes can be fairly numerous and abundant in the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grassland, with patches of species like D. scoparium, P. juniperinum, C. pur pur eus, Pleurozium schreberi and H. splendens providing further continuity with the heath and, though lichens are generally less varied and abundant in the grassy swards, Cornicularia aculeata, Cladonia arbuscula and C. rangi-formis can occur in both vegetation types. This latter element, though, is much more generally obvious in those few localities where the Calluna-Carex heath occurs with the Car ex-Cornicularia community. In that assemblage, C. arenaria is the only constant vascular plant in a characteristically very open turf, with just occasional scattered tussocks of F. ovina and F. rubra, sparse L. campestris and only sporadic representation of most of the dicotyledonous associates listed above. However, H. radicata is common, together with Rumex acetosella, and there are quite often some annuals including Air a praecox. Most striking, though, and providing continuity with the lichen assemblage typical of the Erica sub-community of the Calluna-Carex heath, is Cornicularia aculeata and a great variety and abundance of Cladonia spp. Again, in such patterns, it is the occurrence of the sub-shrubs which provides the major distinction between the vegetation types. There is little doubt that the incidence and intensity of grazing, past and present, mediates much of the variation in patterns such as these developed over tracts of fairly uniform base-poor sands. In other situations, where the Calluna-Carex heath has managed to become established somewhat earlier in the dune succession on sands that are a little less stable or leached, treatments can interact with edaphic differences to produce other zonations. Then, the community usually passes to some https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.055 Published online by Cambridge University Press488 Heaths form of Festuca-Galium grassland, and where this is represented by the Luzula sub-community there can be considerable floristic continuity among the herbaceous element of the vegetation types, with F. rubra, A. capillaris, Anthoxanthum, L. campestris and C. arenaria contributing throughout to the turf. Quite apart from the disappearance of the sub-shrubs, however, the grassland is usually more varied in its vascular component with frequent records for such plants as G. verum, L. corniculatus, Plantago lanceolata, Trifolium repens, Hieracium pilosella, Achillea millefolium, Veronica cha-maedrys and Senecio jacobaea. Bryophytes and lichens are usually not so plentiful either, with Brachythecium albicans, Homalothecium lutescens, Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus and Pseudoscleropodium purum providing the bulk of the cryoptogam cover. More rarely, the Calluna-Carex heath can be found in sharper transitions to Typical Festuca-Galium grassland in which Ammophila may remain locally vigorous with some small measure of continuing accretion, or even to the Ammophila-Festuca community which is characteristic of still quite mobile and lime-rich dune sands around our coasts. Generally, though, the passage to this latter vegetation or to the Carex arenaria community is indicative of secondary local disturbance of the sand surface in tracts of dune or plain which are largely stable, something which can result from the burrowing or scuffing activities of rabbits or recreational activities of human visitors. Transitions to moister ground between dune ridges and in the surrounds to slacks can complicate these patterns. Sometimes, in such situations, there is a fairly sharp switch from heath to some fairly damp dune sward such as the Ranunculus-Bellis or Prunella sub communities of the Festuca-Galium grassland or the Ononis sub-community of Salix-Holcus slack. In other places, the Calluna-Carex heath passes into wet heath or heathy grassland on damp base-poor ground with quite a humic topsoil. There, C. arenaria, F. ovina, Anthoxanthum and G. saxatile can maintain some representation, along with certain of the hypnoid mosses, Calluna persisting patchily on drier areas, but dominance usually passes to mixtures of Erica tetralix, Nardus stricta, Juncus squarrosus and Salix repens. Transitions to such vegetation can be hard to diagnose, but the better-developed assemblages usually seem to be some form of Nardus-Galium grassland or run-down Ericion tetralicis wet heath. Release from grazing can allow stands of the Erica and Empetrum sub-communities to develop the leggy and impoverished look of the Species-poor sub community, with the associated sub-shrubs and many of the herbs and cryptogams overwhelmed by the Calluna. Where soil impoverishment under long-entrenched heather has not become too severe, and where parching of the surface is relieved somewhat, such vegetation may progress to woodland provided suitable seed-parents are not beyond the range of dispersal. Where more open stretches of ground remain among the bushes, birch is a very likely early invader, Betula pendula predominating on these drier soils, with B. pubescens becoming important in transitions to moister ground, where establishment is that much more ready. The appearance of birch, together with Pinus sylvestris and other conifers seeding in from the plantations that are an extensive feature of some stretches of fixed dunes, can presage a fairly speedy succession to thickets of the Quercus-Betula-Deschamp-sia woodland, within which the heath flora survives only in more open glades. In other situations, and particularly where there is some more obvious relief from soil impoverishment after bouts of manuring by stock or infestation with rabbits, or where there is a legacy of disturbance around old enclosures, scrub may supervene in the succession. Often, patches of Ulex-Rubus scrub mark out such enriched areas: Calluna may persist as occasional bushes in such vegetation, with species such as F. rubra, A. capillaris, Anthoxanthum and Galium saxatile forming much of the grassy ground, but the abundance of U. europaeus and R. fruticosus agg. is very striking and there are often patches of more mesophytic grasses like Dactylis glomerata and Holcus lanatus. Pteridium aquili-num can also occur among such scrub, thickening up where deeper sands are kept a little moister along the foot of dunes or on shady aspects into stands of the Pteridium-Galium community. Distribution "
"h12","Zonation and succession The Calluna-Vaccinium heath occurs in a wide variety of vegetation patterns with other sub-shrub communities, mires and grasslands, where floristic differences are controlled primarily by variations in soils, climate and treatments. Successional developments are usually held in check by burning and grazing and without these most stands would eventually progress to scrub and woodland, fragments of which can also be found in association with the community at some sites. The clearest soil-related sequences are seen where the free-draining brown earths or podzols which typically underlie the Calluna-Vaccinium heath give way to seaso-nally-gleyed base-poor soils such as stagnopodzols or gley-podzols. Such zonations sometimes reflect the dis tribution of impervious drift over otherwise fairly uniform ground but they are often disposed over slopes which are increasingly gentle and, in areas of higher rainfall, this kind of sequence can run on over accumulations of ombrogenous peat. In such situations, the shift on to periodically-waterlogged ground is typically marked by a transition to Ericion tetralicis wet heath. Through the heartland of the Calluna-Vaccinium heath, in the east-central Highlands, down through south-east Scotland to the North York Moors, such vegetation is generally represented by the Juncus-Dicranum sub community of the Ericetum tetralicis, in which the most characteristic changes are the appearance of Erica tetralix and Scirpus cespitosus with patchy Molinia caerulea and, in more intact stands, some Sphagnum compactum and S. tenellum. In fact, however, many tracts of this vegetation on grouse-moors and within hill-grazings are also subject to burning and pasturing, which can favour https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.056 Published online by Cambridge University Press498 Heaths the extension across the soil-related boundaries of fairly uniform canopies of heather, impoverished throughout, or, where the treatments have been especially frequent or severe, a progressive run-down with a spread of Juncus squarrosus among a much-reduced cover of sub shrubs, patterns well seen over some tracts of the North York Moors. This is sometimes a prelude to the development of wet Juncus-Festuca grassland though, in the less oceanic uplands, such vegetation tends to be rather local and often related to the occurrence of modest flushing among sequences of dry and wet heaths. Mosaics of these communities can sometimes be seen over the redistributed peat washed down from the eroding margins of blanket bogs over the high plateaus and watersheds of the uplands or extending on to the shallow intact peat of the bog plane proper where the fringes have become dry. But more complete sequences run on from impeded peaty soils to ombrogenous peats with Erico-Sphagnion vegetation, typically of the Cal luna-Eriophorum type with its often rather limited Sphagnum cover but continuing strong representation of sub-shrubs and bulky pleurocarps over its drier stretches. This kind of pattern can be seen on the grandest scale in the Cairngorms, with the various vegetation types disposed in roughly altitudinal zones over the massively-domed granite mountains (Watt & Jones 1948) but it is visible too in the Moffat and Moorfoot Hills in the Southern Uplands (Ward et al. 19726, Ratcliffe 1977, Hill & Evans 1978), the Cheviots and in the unpolluted parts of the Pennines (Tansley 1911, 1939). Such zonations form a pattern analogous to that seen in the more oceanic parts of western Britain, where the communities are generally replaced by the Calluna-Erica dry heath, the Scirpus-Erica wet heath and the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire. However, the geographical separation of these sequences is not complete and, where there is some overlap in their ranges, as in parts of the Southern Uplands, the drier sub-shrub communities generally partition according to altitude or aspect. The Calluna-Vaccinium heath, for example, can be found within the more oceanic zonation in the Moffat Hills and Galloway on higher crags or over slopes with a northerly or easterly aspect; conversely, the Calluna-Erica heath sometimes finds a place in the east-central Highlands on south-facing slopes at lower altitudes. Such shifts are to a great extent a reflection of the competitive balance between Calluna and E. cinerea or the Vaccinia (Figure 28). Other topoclimatic shifts can be seen in the east central Highlands too. Where conditions are particularly cold and humid, as around the steep and largely sunless corries on the northern slopes of the Cairngorms, the Calluna-Vaccinium heath is itself replaced by the Vaccinium-Rubus chamaemorus heath, a widespread community of the north-west and central Highlands but in the latter area often distinctly chionophilous, growing on humic rankers kept wet by long snow-lie. The appearance of R. chamaemorus with scattered Cornus suecica among the sub-shrubs and of patchy Sphagnum capillifolium are good indicators of this transition. Then, in more exposed situations, where rankers and podzols extend over ridges and summits, the Calluna-Vaccinium heath gives way to the Calluna-Cladonia heath in which the sub-shrub cover is often very dwarfed and where fruticose Cladonia spp., of restricted importance in the Calluna-Vaccinium heath, together with other large lichens, can be very varied and abundant. Arctostaphylos uva-ursi sometimes figures locally in such transitions but it is much better represented in zonations and mosaics with Calluna-Vaccinium heath at lower altitudes through the east-central Highlands. There, the Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath has a very similar altitudinal and geographical range to this community and it is possible that burning has some role in mediating switches from one vegetation type to the other. But the Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath is also more consistently associated with less-impoverished soils, typically acidic but often with moder humus rather than mor (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Birse 1980), so a combination of treatment and edaphic factors may be responsible for the distribution of the two. The other widespread interaction between these vari ables involves transitions to Nardo-Galion grasslands, which are especially likely to develop where there has been grazing in the early stages of post-burn recovery. Then the appearance of the Galium-Festuca sub community may presage a succession to the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, the major plagioclimax pas ture of base-poor soils through the upland fringes. Sub shrubs typically have low frequency and cover in that vegetation but moderately heavy grazing may produce a more or less permanently-maintained mosaic of patches of heath among a grassy ground, or sporadic pasturing sustain a shifting balance of the elements in a more labile pattern with all shades of intermediate vegetation, something well seen in the accounts of Scottish grazings by King (1962) and King & Nicholson (1964). In many sites, however, continuous heavy grazing has favoured a progressive loss of sub-shrub vegetation to grassland, something which, over more fertile brown soils, is usually welcomed by graziers, though not by those with an interest in grouse, the numbers of which decline as the heather cover is reduced (e.g. Yalden 1972, Hewson 1977, Anderson & Yalden 1981). The constant danger in such situations, however, is the spread of Pteridium aquilinum which, particularly where the vigour of Cal luna is reduced by the burning and grazing of Calluna-Vaccinium heath over colluvial soils or well-drained drift, is likely to invade vigorously, producing dense https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.056 Published online by Cambridge University PressH12 Calluna vulgaris-Vaccinium myrtillus heath 499 Figure 28.

Over less fertile peaty podzols, heavy grazing may result in the no less difficult problem of the expansion of Nardus stricta and the development of the Nardus-Galium grassland with its poor grazing potential. The kind of pattern seen so well in the map of Moor House in Cumbria (Eddy et al. 1969) is now very typical of many upland areas outside the grouse-moors: there, the zonation runs down from blanket bog on the high watershed, impoverished Eriophorum mire in many places, through a mosaic of Nardus-Galium and Juncus-Festuca grasslands, to Festuca-Agrostis-Galium swards, with ericoids making only a sparse appearance over inaccessible crags and screes. In extreme situations, heavy grazing may prevent the establishment of any vegetation cover on burned tracts of the Calluna-Vaccinium heath and where, by accident or mismanagement, fires have got out of hand and burned deep into the surface humus or even down to the mineral horizons beneath, such a combination of circumstances may be disastrous, triggering erosion by rain run-off or gullyerosion (Gimingham 1972, Maltby 1980, Maltby & Legg 1983). Burning and grazing are so widespread throughout the range of the Calluna-Vaccinium heath that, alone or in combination, they effectively maintain this kind of sub-shrub vegetation as a deflected climax which has little opportunity to progress to woodland, though there is little doubt that, except where it attains higher alti tudes or occurs in rather more exposed situations, this would be the natural trend. And, in the centre of its range, through the east-central Highlands, such developments would be likely to involve the invasion of pine and birch, often with juniper as a precursor or coincidental colonist. All these species are well able to take advantage of the open conditions established after fires, or even of scuffed areas in broken stretches of turf among the Calluna-Vaccinium heath, but the seedlings are very palatable and, where they are not eaten off, are soon crowded out by the regenerating sub-shrubs or herbs and any further germination, a light-dependent process in these plants, precluded (Miles & Kinnaird 1979, Gilbert 1980). With the widespread clearance of woodland, there is also often the problem of the remoteness of seed-parents, particularly critical in the case of pine. Nonetheless, fragments of woody vegetation sur vive quite widely on crags or in ravines within tracts of the Calluna-Vaccinium heath and over the terraced slopes through Speyside and Deeside there can be found some more extensive mosaics of the community with Juniperus-Oxalis scrub and Pinus-Hylocomium woodland (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Ratcliffe 1974, Huntley & Birks 1979«, b): indeed, it is patchworks of these vegetation types, often with Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath, that comprise the 'Caledonian pine forest' in its broad landscape sense. In such patterns, the floristic similarities of the communities are eminently clear and, in many respects, the heath represents the field layer of more open stretches of scrub and woodland without the shrubs and trees. In this part of Britain at least, the Calluna-Vaccinium heath seems to have been derived by clearance of mixed forest of pine, birch and juniper whose elements are now to be seen in largely fragmentary form (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, O’Sullivan 1977). And the increased and long-continued abundance of Calluna in the vegetation which has largely replaced this forest has probably contributed to enhanced podzolisation in the soils (Gimingham 1972, Fitzpatrick 1977), a further factor perhaps in the difficulty of re-establishment of the original kind of climax vegetation. Elsewhere through the range of the Calluna-Vaccinium heath, the community is sometimes found in association with Juniperus-Oxalis scrub but, wherever there is any opportunity for serai progression, it is generally birch, usually Betula pubescens but locally with B. pendula, that is the leading colonist and this can quickly form dense thickets from which the less shade-tolerant heath plants are soon extinguished. Where more mature woodland is able to develop, among which oak can eventually find a place, usually Quercus petraea but with Q. robur sometimes seeding in from planted stock, it is typically of the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum type, with the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland locally represented over less infertile soils. Conifers often invade neglected heaths from plantations and can figure in such woodlands and, in places such as the North York Moors, many of the slopes which might carry Calluna-Vaccinium heath have been afforested with softwoods or, where unburned, have become covered by scrub in which such trees predominate. Distribution "
"h13","Zonation and succession The Calluna-Cladonia heath is typically found with other sub-shrub communities, montane grass-and moss-heaths and snow-bed vegetation in zonations and mosaics which reflect altitudinal and local topographically-determined variations in climate, especially the general temperature trend in moving on to higher ground and exposure. Geological heterogeneity can introduce edaphically-related complications into these patterns and, towards lower altitudes, treatments have often modified the transitions. With the geographical shift to the west, the elements of the vegetation sequence are increasingly replaced by their oceanic counterparts and, in between the climatic extremes, complex intermediate patterns of communities can be seen. The essential features of the altitudinal zonation characteristic of base-poor soils in our more continental mountains are best seen in the Cairngorms, where there is a strong measure of geological uniformity and a massive scale to the scenery, with the broad granite summits and watersheds and relatively gentle transitions in many areas to the lower slopes (Watt & Jones 1948, Poore & McVean 1957). Moreover, the prevailing infertility of the soils has meant that sheep-pasturing has figured little in the history of land-use there, such that sub-shrub heaths remain extensive throughout their climatic zones (Ratcliffe 1977). Not that there has been no modification to the natural vegetation pattern how ever: at lower altitudes, the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland is probably the climax community and, although stretches of this native pine forest remain, much of the ground below the Calluna-Cladonia heath now carries Calluna-Vaccinium heath which spread with clearance and which is now often maintained by burning for grouse-rearing. Many of the soils at these levels, though, are derived from superficials, so there is quite frequently some modest variation in soil fertility, with stands of the Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath marking out less oligotrophic brown earths, and in drainage impedence, the Erice turn tetralicis occupying strongly-gleyed podzols. In some places, too, the Juniperus-Oxalis scrub occurs among mosaics of these heaths, essentially now behaving as a perpetually-renewed serai vegetation. Only on Creag Fhiaclach, at around 640 m on a north-western spur of the Cairngorm range, does this community form a convincing climatically-controlled fringe above the forest zone, grading up to the low-alpine belt, where the Calluna-Cladonia heath is typically found (Poore & McVean 1957). Generally, then, the upward transition to the Calluna-Cladonia heath is from one or other of the sub-shrub communities mentioned above, such that a predominance of heather is maintained, albeit in a dwarfed form at higher altitudes, right up to about 1000 m in these mountains. The shift from one vegetation type to the other is often gradual and the actual altitude at which the change decisively occurs varies with the degree of local exposure because of the strong dependence, in our prevailingly oceanic climate, on topography to maintain the required element of harshness of https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.057 Published online by Cambridge University PressH13 Calluna vulgaris-Cladonia arbuscula heath 509 climate characteristic of the whole low-alpine zone in more continental parts of northern Europe (Poore & McVean 1957). The stunting and wind-flattening of the sub-shrub mat and the abundance of lichens which are the chief general features of the transition thus appear at lower altitudes and more sharply where there is an early and abrupt move from sheltered slopes on to more open, wind-lashed ground. But there can be a strong continuity in the qualitative composition of the canopy even then and stands of the Calluna-Vaccinium and Calluna-A. uva-ursi heaths which are not in the dense pioneer or building phase of regeneration from burning sometimes develop lichen floras which approach those of the Cal luna-Cladonia heath in variety, though not generally in abundance. To such sub-montane heaths, the Cladonia sub community can be seen as transitional and this characteristically occupies the lower and more sheltered situations that develop a cover of Calluna-Cladonia heath, with the Empetrum-Cetraria or Cladonia-Ochrolechia sub-community ranged above it on the more exposed ridges and summits. Where the zonation continues upwards, on to ground that is too inhospitable for the survival of Calluna and where the winds are so strong that even lichens cannot get a hold in any abundance, the Calluna-Cladonia heath typically peters out into a zone of the Juncus-Racomitrium heath. Again, there can be a measure of floristic continuity among the vege tation types: J. trifidus itself makes an occasional appearance in the Calluna-Cladonia heath and a number of species remain frequent over the higher ground, such as Carex bigelowii, Deschampsia flexuosa, Vaccinium myrtillus and, with much reduced covers, various of the lichens. But the overall character of the vegetation is very different and, on the extensive tracts of ground above 1000 m through the Cairngorms, the shift to this rush-dominated community, developed as an open network over the loose erosion surfaces of the high plateaus, is very striking (Poore & McVean 1957, Ingram 1958, McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). The major complications to the higher zones of this kind of transition are related to a decrease in exposure (Poore & McVean 1957). In the low-alpine belt, the sub communities of the Calluna-Cladonia heath themselves can be arranged, not in altitudinal bands, but in patches disposed according to the local variations in the amount of shelter provided by topography. The Empetrum-Cetraria and Cladonia-Ochrolechia sub-communities, for example, can be found at relatively low altitudes where the exposure is locally extreme, while the Cladonia sub-community can attain relatively high levels in hollows and on lee slopes. In this kind of situation, the latter type of Calluna-Cladonia heath is essentially transitional to the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath, which usually seems to experience longer snow-lie and which in some stands has a marked chionophilous character. Sometimes, the two sorts of lichen heath form mosaics over gently-undulating slopes, where the hollows catch a little snow and the convexities are largely blown clear, transitions from one community to the other being sometimes a matter of a shift in dominance from heather to bilberry. In other cases, the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath marks a clear intermediate zone between the Calluna-Cladonia heath and a snow-bed proper with Nardus-Carex grass-heath. At lower altitudes, where a shady aspect becomes progressively necessary to maintain long snow-lie, similar zonations to these can be found but with the Calluna-Cladonia heath giving way over the wind-blasted lip of the snow-bed, not to the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath, but to the Vaccinium-Rubus heath. At higher altitudes where, with some shelter, snow cover settles more uniformly, the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath may largely replace the Calluna-Cladonia heath, maintaining sub-shrub dominance for a further 100 m or so above the heather limit. Quite often, however, the major variation in zonation at the upper limit of the Calluna-Cladonia zone is attributable not so much to increased snow-lie as to the greater constancy of humidity across the cloudy summits away from extreme exposure. Then, there is a progressive tendency for the Calluna-Cladonia heath to give way above, not to the Juncus-Racomitrium heath, but to the Carex-Racomitrium heath, in which dominance typically lies with R. lanuginosum. And, in fact, this is essentially the shift from continental to oceanic conditions for, though no other mountain massif in Britain has so much of the J. trifidus fell-field vegetation as the Cairngorms, even a slight shift away from the more easterly summits reinforces what is there a local trend. Above Glen Feshie, for example, where there are some particularly fine stands of Calluna-Cladonia heath on the south-west facing spurs, the Carex-Racomitrium heath predominates above and with the shift to the Moine schist hills around Drumochter and Ben Alder, a little to the west, the Juncus-Racomitrium heath can be distinctly patchy above the Calluna-Cladonia heath. On Ben Wyvis, a massive bulk of Moine pelitic gneiss some 90 km to the north across the Great Glen, are the biggest tracts of the Carex-Racomitrium heath that we have in Britain, disposed over the broad summits and spurs and having some intricate marginal mosaics with the Cal luna-Cladonia heath, fragments of each community being included within a ground of the other in the boundary zone (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). Then, moving just 25 km to the west, to Beinn Dearg in Ross-shire, there is a decisive shift to a much more oceanic pattern. This massif is unusual among the mountains of the north-west Highlands in that its Moine granulites and schists have been worn down to the kind of broad domed structure so typical of the Cairngorms but here, on the more exposed spurs and summits, R. lanuginosum has a strong edge over the lichens even among the dwarfhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.057 Published online by Cambridge University Press510 Heaths shrub heaths. Below the Carex-Racomitrium zone, then, the Calluna-Cladonia heath is still to be found but it is increasingly replaced through the low-alpine zone in this part of Scotland by the Calluna-Racomitrium heath in which it is mosses that are co-dominant among the dwarfed sub-shrub mat. And, with the move downslope into the forest zone, the Calluna-Vaccinium heath typi cal of the eastern part of the country is often replaced by the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath or, closer to the coastal fringe, the Calluna-Erica heath. As in the more continental sequence, bear berry heath can figure where the soils have moder humus rather than mor, but here it is Arctostaphylos alpinus rather than A. uva-ursi which is characteristic of the higher-altitude complexes of dwarfed sub-shrub heaths. On Beinn Dearg in Ross and Ben Wyvis, the Calluna-Cladonia and Calluna-Racomitrium heaths can both be found in patchworks with the Calluna-A. alpinus heath, their distributions governed by what are probably quite subtle differences in microclimate and soils. In the hills fringing the heart of its range, through Speyside and over some of the central Grampians, the characteristic zonations have been more drastically affected below with the sub-montane heath zone often largely occupied by grasslands derived by long-continued pasturing, and the impact of this sometimes penetrates on to the higher exposed ground where the Calluna-Cladonia heath is typical. Burns, too, can stray upwards though the diminutive canopy of the community does not readily take fire. For the most part, though, such treatments have little effect and this kind of heath can be considered a climax where progression to scrub and woodland is prevented by locally-severe exposure. Distribution "
"h14","Zonation and succession The Calluna-Racomitrium heath characteristically occurs in zonations and mosaics with other sub-shrub vegetation and montane heaths, snow-bed communities and mires where variation is mainly influenced by differences in climate and soils with altitude and local topography. Shifts on to more base-rich profiles derived from less siliceous parent materials can complicate these patterns and treatments have sometimes affected the lower reaches of zonations. The move south-eastwards sees a gradual geographical replacement of the more oceanic vegetation types in these sequences by their continental equivalents and, in the transition zone, intermediate patterns can be found. The typical altitudinal zonation in which the Calluna-Racomitrium heath occurs is well seen in the north-west Highlands over the slopes of Ben More Assynt and Foinaven (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Ratcliffe 1977). Here, the community is found on broad, windswept ridges cut into Cambrian quartzite, generally passing downslope into some other kind of sub-shrub vegetation. Locally, in more sheltered situations at lower altitudes, but where the soils remain relatively free-draining, the Calluna-Racomitrium heath is replaced by the Calluna-Erica heath, the Arctostaphylos sub community of the former and the Racomitrium sub community of the latter representing an almost continuous transition. Generally, however, such a sequence is better seen in the more oceanic conditions found on Skye (Birks 1973) and Orkney (Prentice & Prentice 1975), where the Calluna-Erica heath is much more frequent. And, through the north-west Highlands, too, the move downslope often involves a further shift on to less well-drained ground where some sort of wet heath is the more natural development. Usually, in this part of the country, it is the Scirpus-Erica heath that occurs in this position in the zonation, where shallow peat is beginning to accumulate over gleyed podzolic soils on the gentle slopes of the low-altitude plateaus. Here, the major floristic change is the marked increase in fre quency of Scirpus cespitosus and Molinia and the appearance of Erica tetralix but the pattern of dominance in this kind of vegetation is very varied and, in its Cladonia sub-community, the cryptogamie flora is very similar to that of the Calluna-Racomitrium heath and, again, the Arctostaphylos sub-community can form a gentle transition to it. The usual continuation of this kind of zonation is to Scirpus-Eriophorum blanket mire over the deeper and wetter peats of the waterlogged lower ground. Even where there is some strong element of floristic continuity between the Calluna-Racomitrium heath and the vegetation which replaces it downslope, there is usually an obvious physiognomic change from a mar kedly dwarfed character to a taller, bushier cover in which the vascular associates can make more luxuriant growth. Sometimes, though, as on Foinaven, the community gives way below to prostrate vegetation in which Juniperus communis ssp. nana becomes very common and often co-dominant with the stunted https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.058 Published online by Cambridge University Press518 Heaths heather but where such plants as Erica cinerea, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, A. alpinus and Empetrum nigrum remain quite frequent with usually sparse shoots of Racomitrium lanuginosum and lichens. Such Calluna-Juniperus heath is, like the Calluna-Racomitrium heath, chiono-phobous but it is really a transitional community on the junction of the low-alpine and sub-alpine zones (Poore & McVean 1957) and it has fairly common Pleur ozia purpurea, Frullania tamarisci and Diplophyllum albicans. It can be seen as the north-west Highland equivalent of the Juniperus-Oxalis scrub of the east-central Highlands, though there it is ssp. communis that colonises up to the limit of the forest zone. One other community that can be found at levels which are generally below those of the Calluna-Racomitrium heath, but which is also strongly dependent on cool and very humid conditions associated with shel tered, sunless slopes, is the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath. Here, some measure of floristic continuity is provided by R. lanuginosum and the bulky pleurocarp associates, but the oceanic hepatic component of the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath is so distinctive and its luxuriance so pronounced that there is never any real doubt as to where the transition occurs and, typi cally, it marks an obvious shift in aspect, from southerly or westerly slopes to those facing east or north. But both this vegetation and the Calluna-Juniperus heath can be badly damaged by burning so more diffuse mosaics can sometimes develop. Moving upslope on to ground that remains equally exposed to high winds as that carrying the Calluna-Racomitrium heath, the community is usually replaced by some kind of Carex-Racomitrium heath, a more compendious community in this scheme than previously understood and taking in much of the summit mossheath and some fell-field vegetation of the north-west Highlands. Again, the floristic transition can be a gra dual one with R. lanuginosum in particular retaining high cover, indeed generally increasing its extent to overwhelming dominance of the ground carpet, and Carex bigelowii, Deschampsia flexuosa, Diphasium alpi-num and certain of the lichens continuing in frequency. But Calluna is typically unable to survive at the higher altitudes occupied by this vegetation and, in sites like Ben More Assy nt and Foinaven, there is often additionally a suite of cushion herbs in the Carex-Racomitrium heath that gives the vegetation a very distinctive appearance. An alternative zonation over higher ground can be seen in parts of Foinaven where the Calluna-Racomitrium heath passes on summit blanket peat to the Calluna-Eriophorum mire. Two other complications to the basic pattern of communities deserve note. First, where there is some increase in shelter within the low-alpine zone and a little above it, such that a modest amount of snow can accumulate during the winter in shallow hollows, among block scree and over lee slopes, the Calluna-Racomitrium heath can give way to the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath. Many species run on into this vegetation, but Calluna itself becomes very patchy and dominance generally passes to Vaccinium myrtillus or E. nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum which can thus extend the abundant representation of sub-shrubs to 100 m or more above the upper limit of heather. In other cases, a zone of the Vaccinium-Racomitrium or Vaccinium-Rubus heath forms a transitional belt around snow-beds proper, in cold and sheltered hollows among Calluna-Racomitrium heath. Such patterns are not well developed on Ben More Assynt and Foinaven, but they can be seen on Beinn Dearg where various types of Nardus-Carex vegetation mark out areas of late snow-lie over slopes cut into siliceous granulites, and also on the Lewisian gneiss of the Letterewe hills, though in this range the Calluna-Racomitrium heath itself is reduced to a rather fragmentary zone between Scirpus-Eriophorum blanket mire and the Carex-Racomitrium vegetation of the summits. The other variation involves the occurrence of dwarfed sub-shrub heath in which Arctostaphylos alpi nus is a consistent component, generally without A. uva-ursi, though often with Loiseleuria and various other of the Calluna-Racomitrium species. This, too, is a chiono-phobous vegetation type, characteristic of situations which are, if anything, even more exposed than those typical here and thus sometimes running on upslope from the Calluna-Racomitrium heath a little way over blasted brows. But A. alpinus is also associated with soils in which the humus is more like a moder than a mor, so there may be some subtle edaphic differences involved in patchworks of these vegetation types, such as can be seen on Foinaven and Ben Wyvis. As far east as Ben Wyvis, however, the Calluna-Racomitrium heath has almost petered out as a component of the low-alpine zone which, with increasing continentality of climate, extends to higher altitudes and has the Calluna-Cladonia heath as the prevailing dwarfed sub-shrub vegetation. Indeed, this already figures along with the Calluna-Racomitrium heath in low-alpine mosaics on Beinn Dearg in Ross and over the Affric-Cannich hills but, beyond the line between Ben Klibreck to the north and Ben Alder in the south, the shift away from the oceanic pattern is visible at all levels in the altitudinal zonation. Distribution "
"h15","Zonation and succession The Calluna-Juniperus heath typically occurs at the junction of the sub-and low-alpine zones (Poore & McVean 1957) in sequences of mires, other heaths, https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.059 Published online by Cambridge University Press524 Heaths chionophilous vegetation and grasslands, where the major lines of floristic variation reflect climatic change with altitude and local exposure, edaphic differences and treatment. The community is a climax but is readily degraded by burning. Over the long ridge of Foinaven, the characteristic zonation is perhaps better disposed than on the more rugged landscape of the Beinn Eighe massif. Essentially, the Calluna-Juniper us heath punctuates the typical regional sequence from mire below to fell-field above where quartzite screes are exposed at moderate alti tudes. Immediately beneath it there is generally a mix ture of Calluna-Erica or Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heaths distributed according to aspect and themselves passing below to Scirpus-Erica wet heath and then to Scirpus-Er iophorum mire on the low-altitude blanket peats. The downslope boundary is typically marked by a thinning of the cover of juniper among a sub-shrub cover that is generally taller than here, though many of its associates in the Calluna-Juniperus heath run on with high frequency and abundance. The same is true above, too, where the community gives way over windswept spurs to the Calluna-Racomitrium and/or Calluna-A. alpinus heaths or where these vegetation types replace the Calluna-Juniperus heath over the more exposed south-western slopes of hills. Indeed, although these are characterised by an increase in the cover of cryptogams among the wind-trimmed mat, juniper itself can continue to have patchy representation in them and, where there is a smear of fine morainic material over the ridges, transitions can be especially gradual. These communities in turn can pass directly to Carex-Racomitrium heath or there can be an intervening zone of Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath, or a different kind of zonation altogether to high-altitude Calluna-Erio-phorum mire on the summit blanket peats (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Ratcliffe 1977). Chionophilous vegetation is not well developed among these zonations at Foinaven and, even on Beinn Eighe, there are only moderately late snow-beds but, where north-or east-facing slopes become very shady and cold, the Calluna-Juniperus heath passes to Vacci-nium-Rubus heath or, towards the upper limits of its altitudinal range, Nardus-Carex or Deschampsia-Galium communities. Similar patterns can be seen in Letterewe Forest, though there the Calluna-Juniperus heath itself is rather fragmentary. In some places, too, grassy vegetation is well represented over drier ground above and below the community with Festuca-Agrostis-Galium and Nardus-Galium grasslands or, where there is some flushing with more base-rich waters, the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus or Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla swards . At lower altitudes, especially, a variety of sub-shrub vegetation can be converted to such grasslands by grazing, though the rocky ground characterised by the Calluna-Juniperus heath is often more difficult of access. Where the community has been burned, however, the vegetation may be degraded to a very fragmentary cover with substantial erosion of the exposed soil mantle and from such a condition recovery may be very slow (Poore & McVean 1957, McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). Distribution "
"h16","Zonation and succession With woodland, scrub, other sub-shrub communities and grasslands, the Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath comprises a distinctive suite of vegetation types in the sub-montane zone of the east-central Highlands. These are the var iously-modified derivatives of the original forest cover, produced by clearance, burning and grazing and, in the case of this community, dependent upon management as grouse-moor or rough pasture to prevent regression to secondary woodland. The Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath can be seen in large-scale altitudinal sequences, giving way above to dwarfed heaths and fell-field communities, which are climatic climax vegetation, and there are zonations to wet heath and mire with changes in topography and soils. Long and quite intensive histories of land use in this part of Scotland (e.g. Birks 1970, O’Sullivan 1977, Carlisle 1977) mean that substantial tracts of more natural vegetation are rare. There is little doubt that, in the east-central Highlands, the climax forest type is similar to the vegetation seen today in the Pinus-Hyloco-mium woodland, but many surviving stands of this have been treated for timber production, sometimes involving planting, and the natural regeneration of the community is often somewhat problematical (Steven & Carlisle 1959, McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Ratcliffe 1977). Then, although birch and juniper clearly figured in the original forest patchwork, and sometimes remain today in close association with native pine, many tracts of the Juniperus-Oxalis scrub behave as remnant understoreys, being perpetuated distant from the kind of woodland one might imagine could succeed them and rarely showing any natural progression. Indeed here, too, there is sometimes only sporadic regeneration of the scrub cover itself (Carlisle & Brown 1968, Carlisle 1977, Miles & Kinnaird 1979). The Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath can probably be seen as a further stage in this disruptive reversal of vegetation development, a plagioclimax community that has much in common floristically with the field layers of both these communities, which is sometimes seen among and around them, but which perhaps reverts only with difficulty to its more natural forebears, even when the constraints of regular burning are released. So, although all three communities are very characteristic of the region and form integral elements in the large-scale landscape of what is understood as 'Caledonian pine forest' (Steven & Carlisle 1959, McVean & Ratcliffe 1962), it is only in a relatively few places that they can be seen in a more intimate juxtaposition and, even then, their relationship is rarely in any sense a dynamic one. The stretch of country between Rothie-murchus and Abernethy, in the middle reaches of the Spey, is one of the best areas where the similarities between the vegetation types can be appreciated. On a general level, there can be frequent records in all three for Calluna, V. myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, Deschampsia flexuosa, Hypnum jutlandicum, Dicranum scoparium, Pleurozium schreberi, Hylocomium splendens, such that it often appears as if the heath runs virtually unaltered under the more open stretches of shrubs and trees. More strikingly, although A. uva-ursi itself rarely figures in the scrub or woodland, being intolerant of extensive areas https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.060 Published online by Cambridge University PressH16 Calluna vulgaris-Arctostaphylos uva-ursi heath 533 of deeper shade from which it cannot extend out, there is quite often some continuity between the different com munities in the kind of associated herb flora so distinctive of the Pyrola-Lathyrus sub-community of the Cal luna-A. uva-ursi heath. Where the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland and Juniperus-Oxalis scrub extend on to the less oligotrophic brown soils, for example, more mesophytic grasses and also herbs such as Luzulapilosa, Viola riviniana and Campanula rotundifolia can be found throughout. Moreover, there are also records in each for certain of the Continental Northern and Northern Montane species which give some stands of the Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath a particular phytogeographic stamp: Listera cordata, Trientalis europaea and Pyrola media, for example, provide a common element which confirms the boreal character of these peculiar eastern Scottish vegetation types. Establishment of juniper and pine in stands of Cal luna-A. uva-ursi heath seems to be rare: although both can exploit the post-burn habitat (indeed, perhaps depend on it to a great extent), any regeneration is curtailed by repeated burning or overgrowth of heather. Seed-parents are often distant, too, so, if there is any progression to woodland with cessation of treatment, it is birch that generally predominates among the invaders. On the Muir of Dinnet, for example, Urquhart (1986) indicates a very substantial reduction of the area of the community since 1946 as a result of the spread of birch. The likely development over the less-impoverished brown soils would be the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland, a common secondary forest type in this region and having there a distinctive Anemone sub community, with, again, such species as A. nemorosa, Trientalis, Luzula pilosa, Lathyrus montanus and Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus providing strong floristic continuity with the heath. Where the Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath extends on to more base-poor and oligotrophic podzolised profiles, it is increasingly likely to be subordinate in its extent to the Calluna-Vaccinium heath and, in fact, through the east central Highlands as a whole, this latter community is strongly predominant through the sub-montane zone, the former occurring as what are relatively small islands scattered through it (Urquhart 1986). As indicated earlier, treatment for grouse-rearing may have accentuated the partly edaphic contrast between 'rich' and 'poor' moors, and it seems likely that injudicious burning, leading to an overwhelming dominance of Calluna, with consequent enhancement of podzolisation, could shift the pattern from an abundance of the richer kind of Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath to the poorer Calluna-Vaccinium types. Certainly, with a move towards the latter, the peculiar boreal character of eastern Scottish sub shrub vegetation is lost and, although serai progression to woodland can occur from such heath, where it is abandoned, the secondary birch-dominated Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland that develops is likewise much less floristically distinctive than its more mesophytic counterpart. Mosaics of the two heath communities, with more fragmentary representation of juniper and pine vegetation, are a very characteristic feature of the Grampian foothills throughout Speyside and north of the Dee, and over the lower slopes of the Monadhliath and Cairngorm mountains (Ratcliffe 1977, Urquhart 1986). With the shift to higher altitudes through this region, above the forest zone where they now often comprise the bulk of the cover on more free-draining soils, there is a move to other kinds of sub-shrub vegetation. Over very exposed ridges and spurs, it is the dwarfed Calluna-Cladonia heath that is characteristic, replacing the Cal luna-A. uva-ursi heath at around 670 m in the Cairngorms (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962): A. uva-ursi itself can run on in some abundance into the wind-pruned mat of the lichen heath, and more stunted stands of the Vaccinium sub-community of the Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath can form a transition zone between the two. Beyond, there is then a gradation to Juncus-Racomitrium heath. More sheltered situations at intermediate altitudes in such sequences, particularly where a northerly or east erly aspect ensures longer snow-lie, can have stands of the Vaccinium-Rubus heath. Throughout these altitudinal and topographic zonations, a switch to soils with impeded drainage can see transitions to wet heaths and mires. At lower altitudes, as over the Cairngorm slopes, mosaics of Calluna-A. uva-ursi and Calluna-Vaccinium heaths can pass over gleyed peaty podzols to the Ericetum tetralicis in which mixtures of Calluna and Scirpus can predominate and where Cladonia impexa, C. uncialis and peat-encrusting lichens can provide additional continuity with the Cla donia sub-community of the Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath characteristic of surface-damp humic soils. Over higher ground, blanket peats on plateaus can have a cover of the Calluna-Eriophorum mire above the sub-montane heaths: a particularly striking sequence of this kind can be seen above the Findhorn River in the northern Grampians, where the Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath, including some good Pyrola-Lathyrus type, occupies the steeper slopes, passing over the gently-domed summit of Carn Nan Tri-Tighearnan to spectacular lichen-rich blanket bog. Distribution "
"h17","Zonation and succession The Calluna-A. alpinus heath is typically found with other kinds of sub-shrub vegetation, snow-bed communities, mires and montane sedge-heaths in zonations and mosaics which reflect variations in climate and soils with altitude and local topography and, towards its lower limits, the impact of treatments. With the geographical shift towards the more continental eastern parts of Scotland, there is a replacement of many of the elements in these more oceanic vegetation patterns. The characteristic position of the Calluna-A. alpinus heath, occupying the most exposed situations in the low-alpine zone of the north-west Highlands, is well seen around Beinn Eighe (Ratcliffe 1977). There the community is found on windswept stony moraines on gentle mid-altitude slopes with, below, over the more sheltered drift-covered hillsides, a transition to the Vac-cinium-Rubus heath or, on steeper sunless slopes with constantly high humidity, the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath. Calluna usually remains dominant in both these vegetation types and E. nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum continues as a constant but Vaccinia, particularly V. myrtillus, become more prominent and beneath the taller, more luxuriant canopy of sub-shrubs, there is a rich and extensive carpet of pleurocarpous mosses and Atlantic hepatics, especially in the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath which gives well-developed stands a strikingly different appearance. In some places, as above Loch Maree, fragments of the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland give a clue as to the original forest cover of this zone of damp heather-moor https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.061 Published online by Cambridge University PressH17 Calluna vulgaris-Arctostaphylos alpinus heath 541 but usually the vegetational variety towards the sub montane slopes is provided by transitions to Scirpus-Erica wet heath on moist peaty soils and then to Scirpus-Eriophorum mire on the low-level ombrogenous bogs. Direct zonations from the Calluna-A. alpinus heath to the Scirpus-Erica heath sometimes show considerable floristic continuity where Calluna, Erica cinerea, Scirpus cespitosus and Racomitrium lanuginosum run on with an abundance of lichens over the eroding margins of a peat mantle on stony morainic material. In the north-west Highlands, the Calluna-A. alpinus heath overlaps altitudinally with the Calluna-Juniperus heath and, though this is now a much more local community, the two can sometimes be found in close proximity, as over the north-east slopes of Beinn Eighe, the latter tending to occur a little lower down the mountain sides and best developed on slopes with some shelter and shade. In both composition and physiognomy, the vegetation types are very close with Calluna, E. nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum, A. alpinus and A. uva-ursi all maintaining high frequency in a dwarfed sub shrub cover, but Juniperus communis ssp. nana is scarce in the Calluna-A. alpinus heath and the distinctive hepatics of the juniper heath, Pleur ozia purpurea, Diplophyllum albicans and Frullania tamarisci hardly ever occur in the more exposed situations at these altitudes. The Calluna-Juniperus heath is a chionophobous community and in hollows among stretches of Calluna-A. alpinus heath where snow accumulates, there can be sharp transitions to Nardus-Carex vegetation of various kinds. This community can run on up into the mid-alpine zone where shelter is sufficient to allow a snow cover to remain but, very typically through the northwest Highlands, the Calluna-A. alpinus heath gives way over exposed rounded high-altitude spurs and summits to the Carex-Racomitrium heath, the characteristic moss-heath and fell-field vegetation of our cold oceanic mountains. Again, there can be some floristic continuity through Racomitrium lanuginosum and the lichens and Carex bigelowii, Vaccinium myrtillus and Deschampsia flexuosa and the physiognomic similarity of the communities is well seen where solifluction and wind erosion combine to fragment the cover of the heath into a mosaic of vegetation among stretches of bare morainic gravel. Typically, however, heather does not extend to the higher altitudes and, though Loiseleuria can occasionally be found, the summit vegetation is typically moss-dominated and often distributed over striking tracts of open ablation surfaces. In fact, over the rugged peaks of Beinn Eighe, the Carex-Racomitrium heath is not nearly so extensive in the zone above the Calluna-A. alpinus heath as on Beinn Lair in Letterewe, over the Fannich Hills, on the massive rounded tops of Beinn Dearg and, towards the north-western limit of the mainland range of the community, on Ben Klibreck. On the last site, too, can be seen an alternative transition over high-altitude plateau to Calluna-Eriophorum blanket mire. Throughout this main part of its range, though again more obviously on some of these other mountains than on Beinn Eighe, the Calluna-A. alpinus heath overlaps geographically and altitudinally with the closely-similar Calluna-Racomitrium heath. Sometimes, as along the seaboard of the north-west Highlands, where broad exposed spurs extend down to relatively low altitudes, it is this latter community that is predominant, with the Calluna-A. alpinus heath prevailing with the shift into the higher, mountainous heartland. But, as in the Letterewe Hills and Beinn Dearg and also on Hoy in Orkney, the two can occur contiguously, the moss-heath perhaps occupying the somewhat less sheltered situations with mor soils but sometimes showing no apparent habitat preference. Towards the eastern margin of the range of the Calluna-A. alpinus heath there is a further complication in that the geographical ranges of the western heaths overlap there with that of the Calluna-Cladonia heath. On Ben Wyvis and Ben Klibreck, for example, the latter occurs in mosaics with the Calluna-A. alpinus heath, the distribution of the alpine bearberry often effectively serving to distinguish the two. All these three dwarfed sub-shrub heaths are climatic climax communities but they are often contiguous below with vegetation markedly influenced by treatments, particularly the burning and grazing associated with hill-pasturing. The Calluna-A. alpinus heath thus sometimes gives way below, or towards its lower altitudinal limits is surrounded by plagioclimax Nardo-Galion swards, such as the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium or Nardus-Galium grasslands, in which sub-shrubs may survive patchily but where dominance lies with the grasses and dicotyledons which make but an occasional appearance here. Distribution "
"h18","Zonation and succession The Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath can be seen as a part of altitudinal sequences from sub-montane woodlands, grasslands and sub-shrub vegetation through to high-level moss-heaths and fell-field where transitions reflect increasing harshness of climate above and biotic influences below, with additional zonations to mire communities with edaphic shifts. Within the low-alpine zone, the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath occurs as a climax vegetation type among dwarfed sub-shrub com munities and snow-beds, patterns being determined largely by gradients of exposure and snow-lie. Through much of its range, fragmentation of the forest cover towards the upper limit of the sub-montane zone is such that it is often difficult to see the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath as the high-altitude replacement of woodland or sub-alpine scrub. But the floristic continuity between the different vegetation types is very striking and many of the heath plants form an integral part of the field layers of the Quercion and Dicrano-Pinion woodlands found over more base-poor soils on siliceous bedrocks and drift at lower levels. Towards the west of Scotland and down through northern England and Wales, the Hylocomium-Rhytidiadelphus sub community reaches down to the upper altitudinal limits of the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland and, where fragments of this remain in ravines or on screes, they sometimes give way above to a fringe of the bilberry heath (Lewis & Moss 1911, Ferreira 1978). Similar patterns occur in eastern Scotland, too, though here it is the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland that probably represents the sub-montane climax vegetation and, around the Cairngorms, the Hylocomium-Rhytidiadelphus sub community replaces it on more sheltered sites above. Here, also, the Juniperus-Oxalis scrub can be seen as a convincing intermediate in the sequence, occurring at the natural upper limit of tree growth in some places, though hardly ever in zonations which run right through from the montane heath above to the woodland below. In other places, it is tail-herb vegetation, generally of the Luzula-Vaccinium type, or the Thelypteris limbosperma community, that provides floristic continuity between the extremes of the sequence, ferns, tall herbs, shrubs and trees thus representing the structural elements appearing towards lower altitudes. Analogous patterns to these can be seen where less base-poor profiles developed from calcareous substrates are disposed over slopes of increasing altitude. Here, the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath can maintain its rep resentation on the higher ground, but it occurs generally as the Alchemilla-Carex sub-community, a replacement well seen in comparing the zonations of the Cairngorms with those of the Breadalbane-Clova area, or in moving across the boundary of siliceous and calcareous rocks on the summit ridge of Carn a’Chlarsaich near The Cairnwell (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). And, in the sub montane, the climax forest is the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland or the less markedly calcifuge types of Pinus-Hylocomium woodland. Again, floristic similarity is obvious, spatial continuity rare because of forest destruction. The widespread occurrence of woodland clearance and the prevalence of burning and grazing through the sub-montane zone thus often mean that the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath gives way below to anthropogenic sub-shrub communities maintained for sheep or grouserearing. Through much of its range, its replacement at lower altitudes is the Calluna-Vaccinium heath, with the Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath figuring on less infertile soils in eastern Scotland, and the Calluna-Deschampsia heath prevailing in the polluted southern Pennines. Heather tends to be an overwhelming dominant in each of these vegetation types and, even where other sub-shrubs play a part, as in the early stages of regeneration after burning, the Arctic-Alpines are generally less prominent than in the bilberry heath, but the floristic similarities are considerable, both among the vascular plants and the cryptogam element. In some situations, as over the crags and screes of the Pennine grits, which rise to higher ground separated by intervening tracts of blanket mire on the dips, the contrast between the sub-montane Calluna-Deschampsia heath and the high-altitude Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath can be quite striking (Lewis & Moss 1911, Tansley 1939). In other places, the shift to higher ground is also marked by an increase in slope and, on northern exposures, of shade which favour the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath on cool steep talus and cliffs, well seen in Edgell's (1969) map of Cader Idris. But, often, the transition between the vegetation types is a gradual one, and it can be particularly complicated where shelter below favours bilberry, while the extension of treatments on to higher ground favours heather. Towards its lower altitudinal limits, and particularly https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.062 Published online by Cambridge University PressH18 Vaccinium myrtillus-Deschampsia flexuosa heath 551 over warmer south-facing slopes, it seems likely that some stretches of the Alchemilla-Carex sub-community have been biotically derived and are now maintained as plagioclimax intermediates between the forest types noted above and Nardo-Galion grasslands. In parts of the Southern Uplands, for example, in the Cheviot (King 1962), Breadalbane (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962) and Caenlochan (Huntley 1979), this kind of Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath is commonly found among Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus and Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grasslands, the disposition of the different elements of the mosaics being a rather complex function of treatments, topoclimate and edaphic factors (King 1962, Huntley 1979). Zonations to the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grassland can be especially gradual, but the difference between the communities is partly one of the proportions of sub-shrubs to grasses and A. alpina and partly to do with the more frequent occurrence of mesophytes and mildly calcicolous plants in the grassland. With increasing altitude, however, and a decisive shift into the low-alpine zone of the higher mountains within the range of the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, it is natural factors, particularly exposure and snow-lie, which determine the major trends in the vegetation patterns. Thus, wherever there is a move on to slopes which feel the force of strong winds and which are thus blown clear of snow, the community tends to be replaced by dwarfed sub-shrub vegetation in which V. myrtillus plays but a small role and where stunted heather is generally abundant. In the central and eastern Highlands, such vegetation is usually of the Calluna-Cladonia heath, where the lichens which are generally of small cover in the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath assume a sometimes co-dominant role and where distinctly chio-nophobous species can be found. In the opposite direction, with an increase in the duration of snow-lie, the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath is replaced by Nardus-Carex vegetation, with its shift to abundance of Nardus and C. bigelowii and preferentially frequent Scirpus cespitosus and Juncus squarrosus. Zonations between these communities can be found disposed over slopes of differing aspect, around nivation hollows (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962) and over the treads and risers of terraced slopes (Burges 1951), where sometimes quite subtle variations in inclination and shelter are sufficient to influence the balance between the species. A further complication in some sites is the occurrence among these sequences of the Vaccinium-Rubus heath, a vegetation type that seems equally chionophilous to the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, but where Calluna can maintain a better representation, with Rubus chamaemorus preferentially frequent. Sometimes, too, the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath can be found at similar altitudes to the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath. Like the Calluna-Cladonia heath, this is very lichen-rich vegetation in which sub-shrubs are often reduced to a co-dominant role, but it is not a chionopho-bous community: indeed, it probably experiences simi lar duration of snow-lie to the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath. V. myrtillus maintains its frequency there and both E. nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum and V. vitis-idaea are common, the former often in abundance. But Cladonia spp. are much more plentiful along with Carex bigelowii and this is a vegetation type which can extend to higher levels than the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, representing a transition to the Juncus-Racomitrium or Carex-Racomitrium heath on summit fell-fields. The Racomitrium-Cladonia sub-community can sometimes be found as a transition to these low-alpine com munities. With the geographical shift towards the north-west Highlands the elements in these zonations tend to move to somewhat lower altitudes and, in some cases, to be replaced by more oceanic equivalents. The Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath can still be found in this part of Scotland, although in this scheme, some of the vegetation which McVean & Ratcliffe (1962) grouped within their Festuceto-Vaccinetum rhacomitrosum is transferred to the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath. With its typically western abundance of R. lanuginosum, this community, together with the local stands of Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, occupies part of the low-alpine zone, being replaced below by the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath, where oceanic hepatics can play a prominent role, and passing at higher altitudes to Carex-Racomitrium heath. Sub-shrub vegetation dependent on a humid climate, is, in this part of Britain, less strictly confined to shaded aspects but transitions to Nardus-Carex vegetation can be seen where snow persists and the community is also found among stretches of the chionophilous Deschampsia-Galium grassland. Over exposed spurs in this part of Scotland, the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath is replaced by the Calluna-Racomitrium or Calluna-A. alpinus heaths. Distribution "
"h19","Zonation and succession The Vaccinium-Cladonia heath is a characteristic ele ment in the sequences of sub-shrub communities and snow-bed vegetation of the low-alpine zone of the continental mountains of the east and central Highlands, among which floristic variation is strongly related to exposure and snow-lie. Here, it occurs at the limit of ericoid dominance, marking the altitudinal transition in more sheltered situations from sub-alpine and sub montane heaths to summit moss-heath, fell-field or mire. Geology and soils affect the particular kinds of communities represented with the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath and, towards lower altitudes, treatments have modified the vegetation cover but these are not important in maintaining the community itself. The broad altitudinal zonations in which the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath plays an integral part are most https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.063 Published online by Cambridge University Press560 Heaths obvious over the upper slopes of the Cairngorms and on the mountain tops of the Breadalbane-Clova region. On the impoverished granite soils typical of the former area, where there has been relatively little impact of sheepgrazing, sequences of sub-shrub vegetation are extensive, starting with mosaics of the Calluna-Vaccinium and Calluna-A. uva-ursi heaths with fragments of Pinus-Hylocomium woodland and Juniperus-Oxalis scrub through the sub-montane and up into the sub-alpine zone. Above these levels, past the present limits of tree growth and beyond the influence of the regular burning employed to regenerate the lower-altitude heaths for grouse-rearing, the particular zonation becomes strongly dependent on exposure. Wind-blasted spurs and ridges have the Calluna-Cladonia heath and, though the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath finds occasional representation in such situations, it is usually in less exposed places that the community begins to make an obvious contribution to the cover. Indeed, the effects of local shelter can already be seen at lower altitudes in this region, where the Hylocomium-Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath often marks out large shallow snowbeds towards the transition to the sub-alpine zone, with the Polytrichum-Galium sub-community of the Vacci-nium-Rubus heath extending even further below, where easterly or northerly aspects provide shaded and cool conditions. Observation suggests (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962) that each of these vegetation types experiences roughly similar regimes of snow-lie and, among them, the Empetrum-Cladonia sub-community of the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath can be seen as the high-altitude representative of a mildly chionophilous suite. Quite often, however, mosaics of the Vaccinium-Cladonia and Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath can be found disposed across hillsides in the low-alpine zone, the enclosed patches of the latter being marked out by a shift from a predominance of lichens among the cryptogamie ele ment to bulky pleurocarps, and by the appearance of species like Blechnum spicant and Cornus suecica. Although there are places where the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath can be seen in extensive tracts, the more usual picture is for this kind of mosaic to continue, with moves to slopes that are more exposed or less, to the Calluna-Cladonia heath on the one hand or to snow-bed vegetation on the other. Transitions to the former are typical of gently undulating hillsides, where the rounded spurs get blown clear of snow, the concavities accumulating a little, and where the move from one community to the other is denoted largely by a replacement of heather by bilberry among a superabundant ground of lichens. Similar transitions can be seen on moving off the exposed tops of the risers on terraced slopes on to the sheltered treads and on shifting round from wind-blasted slopes on to more sheltered aspects and here the Racomitrium sub-community is sometimes seen as a transition to either Nardus-Carex or Car ex-Poly trichum snow-beds. Moves towards the former involve a reduction in the contribution of V. myrtillus and the less snow-tolerant lichens, with an increase in the abundance of R. lanuginosum and a marked dominance of Nardus stricta. In the latter, V. myrtillus and the other sub-shrubs are often absent, but C. bigelowii remains prominent with chionophilous bryophytes such as Polytrichum alpinum and Dicranum fuscescens very common. In such pat terns, the patches of the different vegetation types can vary from just a few square metres to hectares in extent. The greater snow-tolerance of the Vaccinia and E. nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum over Calluna means that the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath often runs on above the limit of the Calluna-Cladonia heath, maintaining a strong sub-shrub representation for a further hundred metres or more and, in such situations, it can replace it in moderately exposed habitats just within the mid-alpine zone. Over the windy and cloud-ridden summits of the Cairngorms, however, the community typically gives way to the Juncus-Racomitrium fell-field vegetation or, more locally, the Carex-Racomitrium heath. V. myrtillus continues with some frequency into such communities, though at low covers, and dominance is usually shared between such plants as C. bigelowii, R. lanuginosum, F. ovina and J. trifidus. Very similar zonations to these can be seen on Monadhliath and Lochnagar but, with the move on to the Dalradian rocks of the Clova area and down to Breadalbane, where lime-rich exposures begin to figure prominently, there are some differences in the vegetation types represented in the various altitudinal zones and, with many of the mountains having small or sloping summits, the upper end of the sequence is often trun cated. The Empetrum-Cladonia sub-community of the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath can be found over quartzose mica-schists and other siliceous rocks through this region but, quite often, it is the Festuca-Galium sub community that is represented over the more base-rich rocks, and here this continues upwards the mildly chionophilous character of the Alchemilla-Carex sub community of the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath. Towards lower altitudes, this in turn can pass to Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grassland where sheep-grazing res tricts the contribution from the sub-shrubs. Over the less siliceous rocks, the Calluna-Cladonia heath tends to be poorly represented, even where there is quite severe exposure, but some kinds of later snow-beds can be seen over ground where there is a little more shelter than with the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath, with transitions to certain kinds of Nardus-Carex and Car ex-Poly trichum vegetation. Towards the north-west of Scotland, the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath retains some representation in sequences https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.063 Published online by Cambridge University PressH19 Vaccinium myrtillus-Cladonia arbuscula heath 561 that have an altogether more oceanic character, sub suming some of the vegetation which McVean & Rat cliffe (1962) placed in their Festuceto-Vaccinetum rhacomitrosum. In this part of Britain, the effects of the greater humidity of climate are felt to some extent on all aspects and R. lanuginosum-rich bilberry heaths occur widely between 400 and 1000 m where there is some measure of shelter from winds. The bulk of them can be grouped within the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath where there is a consistent shift away from lichens as the usual co dominants in the mat, but the Racomitrium sub community of the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath is seen locally as a geographical transition to this more western vegetation type. At lower altitudes the sequences among the heaths pass to Vaccinium-Rubus and Calluna-Vacci-nium-Sphagnum heaths, and upwards there is extensive Carex-Racomitrium heath over the broader summits, with Nardus-Carex snow-beds in sheltered hollows. Distribution "
"h2","Zonation and succession Zonations between the Calluna-Ulex minor heath and other vegetation types are generally related to edaphic variation or to differences in treatment. Burning and grazing can modify soil-related patterns and also create effects of their own: most obviously they mediate the invasion of this vegetation by trees and very often now, with their decline, the community survives as a decreasing element in patchworks of woodland, heath and bracken. Elsewhere, stands give way abruptly to agricultural land, coniferous forest or encroaching settlements. In the traditional kind of heath landscape of central southern and south-east England, preserved extensively now only in the New Forest, the imposition of grazing and burning over large areas enables the effect of edaphic variation to be seen in a very distinctive sequence of sub-shrub communities. Within this pat tern, the Calluna-Ulex minor heath occupies the most free-draining of the series of acid and impoverished soils, typically podzols which show no tendency, or only a slight one, towards surface-water gleying in winter. With the shift to profiles with somewhat more severe or consistent drainage impedence, as where there is a strong pan development or a markedly argillic B hori zon, the community typically gives way, through the Dorset and Hampshire area, to the Ulex minor-Agrostis curtisii heath. The boundary between the vegetation types can be ill-defined, but, in this moderately oceanic part of Britain, the move on to soils which show even only a slightly greater tendency to gleying is marked by the consistent appearance of E. tetralix along with E. cinerea, and the replacement of D. flexuosa by Molinia and A. curtisii. The sequence of vegetation types then continues with the Ericetum tetralicis, on seasonally surface-waterlogged ground, and the Narthecio-Sphagnetum on valley-mire peat accumulated in elongated hollows. The clarity of this pattern, characteristic of the undulating sand and gravel landscapes of this part of Britain (Rose 1953) and described in detail from Cranesmoor by Newbould (1960), depends on the exact conformation of the ground and its hydrology: over generally less impeded surfaces, the drier elements in the sequence prevail; where wetter hollows predominate, the role of the Calluna-Ulex minor heath is much reduced and, in areas of complex topography, fine mosaics of the com munities can replace ordered zonations. Geological heterogeneity, too, can introduce additional variation in soils and vegetation: patches of less sharply-draining sands or clay-sands, for example, can weather to deep acid brown earths with a cover of the Pteridium-Galium community, and stretches of somewhat more fertile soils often have stands of the Ulex-Rubus scrub, as in the New Forest 'brakes'. Although burning and grazing play a crucial role in preserving the generally open character of this landscape, they can affect the soil-related pattern. Among the heaths, for example, such treatments can favour a general dominance throughout of Calluna, the abundance of which may swamp variation in the subordinate preferentials of the different communities; and certain regimes of burning and grazing may allow the replacement of the heaths by Nardo-Galion or Junco-Molinion grasslands or alter the balance between heather and bracken. Disturbance of the soils, as around settlements or plantations or along tracks, can also lead to a spread of Ulex-Rubus scrub within the Calluna-Ulex minor heath. Such sequences of heath communities, intermixed with bracken, gorse and acid grasslands, can still be seen, though not so extensively, around Poole Harbour, where the Calluna-Ulex minor heath is well represented in the Arne area, and on Iping Common in Sussex, Thursley, Hankley and Chobham Commons in Surrey (Ratcliffe 1977); at Ambersham Common and in Ash down Forest in Sussex, wetter heaths and mire tend to prevail, though in this part of Britain, the Ulex minor-Agrostis heath is absent, the Calluna-Ulex minor heath passing directly to the Ericetum tetralicis, sometimes with the Molinia sub-community as a transition zone. In many of these and other smaller sites in the south-east, too, the soil-related zonation is overlain by patterns resulting from the neglect of burning and grazing, and other traditional heathland treatments like the cutting of bracken for bedding and of gorse for fuel. In the rainier parts of The Weald, the Vaccinium sub-community is typical of such neglected dry heaths, with its tree seedlings able to get away quickly in less densely-shaded areas. The commonest woody invaders in such situations are birch, particularly B. pendula on these drier soils, and oak, generally Q. robur, though with Q. petraea locally important. Pines, particularly P. sylvestris, can also be very abundant where seed-parents are close and other colonisers include occasional Sorbus aucuparia and, particularly striking in ungrazed or unburned stands in the New Forest, Ilex aquifolium (Peterken & Tubbs 1965, Tubbs 1968). On some Surrey commons, Amelanchier lamarckii has become thor oughly naturalised among birch thickets developing among the Calluna-Ulex minor heath, easily overlooked in summer but very obvious in April with its lovely white flowers and again with its crimson autumn foliage. The immediate product of this kind of invasion is the characteristic 'oak-birch heath' described from southhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.046 Published online by Cambridge University Press388 Heaths east England (Tansley 1911, 1939, Wooldridge & Gold-ring 1953) which is actually open, immature Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland, locally dominated in its early stages by patchworks of oak, birch, pine or holly, but showing considerable floristic continuity with the heath in its field layer, Calluna and U. minor persisting in more open areas, Pteridium, Deschampsia flexuosa and V. myrtillus maintaining high cover even under the deepening shade of the closing canopy. Oak is typically the eventual dominant in this kind of woodland which, even within the supposed natural range of beech (in which the Calluna-Ulex minor heath falls), often seems to have a stability of its own, perhaps not irrevocably yielding to the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland, even though this is often taken to be the natural climax on base-poor soils in this region. In fact, although young beech can sometimes be found in this community, and though this species can attain dominance by such invasion (as in some of the New Forest woodlands: Peterken & Tubbs 1965, Tubbs 1968), colonisation by Fagus is a sporadic and localised event, depending on the occurrence of good mast years in mature trees close to stands of the Calluna-Ulex minor heath (Watt 1923, 1924, 1925). Such a line of succession may thus often remain a theoretical pathway. Distribution "
"h20","Zonation and succession The Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath is typically found at the transition between the sub-shrub vegetation of the low-alpine zone and the moss-heaths and fell-field com munities of the higher slopes and summits of the mountains of north-west Scotland, the general zonation ref lecting the increased harshness of climate with the move to upper slopes. Local variations in exposure over the intermediate slopes commonly result in gradations from the community to wind-blasted heaths and snow-bed vegetation. The characteristic altitudinal pattern in which the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath occurs is well seen over the upper slopes of mountains like those of the Letter-ewe Forest, Beinn Dearg and Am Faochagach in Ross and Ben More Assynt and Foinaven in Sutherland, where the community occurs towards the lower limit of the Carex-Racomitrium heath. This vegetation is par ticularly extensive over the more rounded summits in the north-west Highlands, often as the distinctive Silene sub-community with its suite of cushion herbs, or in its Typical form with overwhelming dominance of Racomitrium, or grading into more open fell-field on active ablation surfaces. Floristic continuity between these kinds of vegetation and the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath is strong, with the Cetraria sub-community here looking very much like a sub-shrub facies of Typical Carex-Racomitrium heath: indeed in many situations, the former occurs as small patches in hollows or over blocky detritus among the lower reaches of the latter, picked out from a distance by the close canopy of E. nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum and V. myrtillus, but otherwise showing great qualitative similarity among the vascular associates and cryptogams. Usually, the hyp-noid mosses are more frequent in the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath and, of course, in the Rhytidiadelphus-Hylocomium sub-community, their abundance is very striking. Where this kind of vegetation replaces the Cetraria sub-community in mosaics of this sort, as can be seen on Ben Klibreck in Sutherland and locally elsewhere, the contrast between the elements of the pattern is that much greater. In other situations, the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath forms a more extensive zone below the summit vegetation, becoming especially prominent where the increase in slope is also marked by a shift to rough, bouldery ground on screes. Here, it can be seen as a transition to the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, the Hylocomium-Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of which is very close in its general composition, but where there https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.064 Published online by Cambridge University PressH20 Vaccinium myrtillus-Racomitrium lanuginosum heath 569 is a move to more consistent eclipse of R. lanuginosum by the hypnaceous mosses with increased shelter and moisture. Alternatively, decreasing altitude can be marked by a replacement of the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath by sub-shrub vegetation in which Calluna plays a more prominent role. This can be seen over both sheltered and exposed slopes. In the former case, where a northerly or easterly aspect results in an especially cool, shady and humid environment, the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath is typically represented by the Bazzania-Mylia sub community and this usually passes to the Plagiothecium-Anastrepta sub-community of the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath at levels where the snow cover becomes less appreciable: bilbery and crowberry decrease in vigour with some slight shifts in the composition of the luxuriant hepatic mat that characterises both these vegetation types with the move to a less montane environment. In other places, where a drop in altitude is accompanied by increasing exposure to harsh winds that blow away any snow that does fall, the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath is replaced by the Calluna-Racomitrium heath. In general composition and physiognomy, these two are quite similar but the latter usually displays little contribution from V. myrtillus and the hypnoid mosses of the former have a limited role there. Nonetheless, the communities can come very close in their suites of vascular associates, especially where both extend to their lowest altitudes along the north-western seaboard of Scotland and on Skye, where the Viola-Thymus sub community here and the Festuca sub-community of the Calluna-Racomitrium heath show a floristic convergence. At higher altitudes in the hinterland of northwest Scotland, it is usually the Cetraria sub-community of the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath and the Empetrium sub-community of the Calluna-Racomitrium heath that occur together in these altitudinal zonations, sometimes with the Calluna-A. alpinus heath, another dwarfed sub shrub community of wind-blasted spurs, complicating the pattern, as on Foinaven. In the middle reaches of the low-alpine zone on such mountains, these vegetation types can be disposed not so much in an altitudinal pattern as in patchworks over the slopes reflecting retention of snow in less or more sheltered situations. The Calluna-Racomitrium and Cal luna-A. alpinus heaths represent the most exposed extreme at these levels, with the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath transitional to early snow-bed vegetation. Sometimes, indeed, it can be seen as a surround to more chionophilous communities, though it often forms an element of complex and extensive mosaics with, for example, certain kinds of Nardus-Carex vegetation. Patchworks of the Empetrum-Cetraria sub-community and the Cetraria sub-community of the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath are especially well seen on the Letter-ewe Hills, the Affric-Cannich Hills, Foinaven, Beinn Dearg and Ben Klibreck, where sometimes quite gentle transitions between the components depend on the proportions of the sub-shrubs and Nardus against a ground of abundant R. lanuginosum with frequent hyp noid mosses and lichens. In some sites, other grassy chionophilous vegetation like the Deschampsia-Galium community, can also occur in these patterns with V. myrtillus and hypnoid mosses running on with some frequency and local abundance. Or there may be sharper transitions to late snow-bed communities. Distribution "
"h21","Zonation and succession The Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath is a very local sub-alpine element in the oceanic zonations characteristic of the north-west Highlands, grading above to more montane sub-shrub communities and moss-heaths, and often passing below to wet-heath and mire vegetation. At higher altitudes, variations in exposure and snow-lie affect the patterns of communities, while at lower elevations there is increased influence of burning and grazing. Floristically, the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath is very close to certain kinds of woodland and, though there is rarely now any spatial continuity between the vegetation types, it is possible that clearance is responsible for their wide altitudinal separation, and that, in some situations, this is not a climax community. The usual approach to stands of the Calluna-Vacci-nium-Sphagnum heath is across tracts of Scirpus-Erio-phorum bog or, on higher altitude terraces, the Calluna-Eriophorum bog, with a zone of Scirpus-Erica wet heath marking the transition to the more steeply-sloping ground where the peat cover thins and becomes better drained. The boundary between this last vegetation type and the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath running up on to the rocky ground in such zonations, is generally clear, particularly where large amounts of Molinia or Scirpus figure in the wet heath. In some cases, though, the communities can come quite close: the Vaccinium sub-community of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath has very frequent and sometimes prominent sub-shrubs and a ground layer in which hypnaceous mosses are as common and abundant as Sphagna, and it can grade fairly imperceptibly into the Calluna-Pteridium sub community here. Alternatively, there may be a transition zone of Typical Calluna-Erica heath between the ombrogenous vegetation and the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath. Such patterns are well seen around the base of the corries on An Teallach and on Foinaven (Ratcliffe 1977). In such situations, heather can remain a prominent feature of the vegetation cover to moderately high altitudes. On the shady and damp slopes where the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath is found, the community generally marks its upper limit of real vigour, increasing snow-lie over the higher talus and cliff bases being marked by a shift to the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath, the Bazzania-Mylia sub-community of which shares many of the same hepatics as the Mastigo-phora-Herbertus sub-community here. Laterally, both vegetation types may fragment over rocky ground, becoming restricted to ledges and crevices, or being replaced there by tail-herb vegetation of the Luzula-https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.065 Published online by Cambridge University Press580 Heaths Vaccinium or Luzula-Geum communities, with the more species-poor examples of which these heaths show con siderable floristic continuity, among both the vascular associates and the bryophytes. Liathach and some of the Letterewe crags show this kind of feature. Towards these higher altitudes, variation in exposure becomes a major factor in determining the kinds of zonation in which the community is found. Over steep banks or in hollows where snow lies longer, the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath can be replaced by the Hylocomium-Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath or the Plagiothecium-Anastrepta sub-community of the Vaccinium-Rubus heath, in both of which there is a continuing strong contribution from hypnaceous mosses, with occasional, locally abundant Atlantic hepatics, beneath a bilberry or crowberry canopy. The transitions to the Vaccinium-Rubus heath can be especially smooth: indeed, McVean & Ratcliffe (1962) included some of this vegetation in their Vaccineto-Callunetum as a suecicosum facies. But the constancy of Cornus suecica and Rubus chamaemorus and occasional occurrence of Eriophorum vaginatum in the more chionophilous community will usually serve as a distinction and, though species such as A. orcaden-sis, Bazzania tricrenata and Diplophyllum albicans remain reasonably frequent, the integrity of the more strictly Atlantic assemblage becomes fragmented. The same is true of the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, too, although additionally with the passage to this vegetation type, there is an increase in the frequency of grasses, notably Nardus, Agrostis canina, A. capillaris and F. ovina. This can presage a shift to the Nardus-Carex community of later snow-beds in which the hepatics are very fragmentarily represented. Mosaics of these vegetation types can be seen over the higher slopes of An Teallach and in the hills of the Letterewe and Monar Forests (Ratcliffe 1977). Some continuity among the hepatics can also be seen in those few places where the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath is contiguous with the Calluna-Juniperus heath, a community best developed on cool, shady slopes of moderate altitudes where the ground is blown clear of snow in winter. It is especially associated with fields of frost-shattered Cambrian quartzite and is well seen on Foinaven around the steeper ground which has a mosaic of dry and damp heather vegetation (Ratcliffe 1977). Shifts from the sheltered slopes carrying the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath on to ground which is much more exposed to strong winds usually see a sharp replacement of the community by such dwarfed sub shrub vegetation as the Calluna-Racomitrium or Cal luna-A. alpinus heaths, in which heather can attain considerably higher altitudes and where R. lanuginosum is the predominant component of the often extensive moss carpet. Such transitions can be seen over the windswept lips of corries and cliff's and over lateral transitions to exposed spurs, as on Foinaven (Ratcliffe 1977) and above the Enegars cliff's on Hoy (Prentice & Prentice 1975), where they can mark a shift to summit moss-heath and fell-field communities. Towards the upper end of its altitudinal limit, the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath appears to form a natural component of vegetation patterns controlled largely by variations in local climate and soils. On lower ground, however, it extends into the zone of communities that have often been strongly affected by various kinds of treatment. Where the surrounding heaths have been burned and grazed, for example, the transition to neighbouring communities is often sharpened up by a biotically-related dominance of heather in either the Calluna-Erica or Scirpus-Erica heaths or, conversely, by a virtual elimination of dwarf-shrubs in Nardo-Galion swards of various kinds, to which the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath can form an intermediate, or Molinia-dominated wet heath. Although the damp slopes over which the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath occurs are protected somewhat against the ravages of fire by the moistness of the ground and vegetation, it seems certain that the extent of the community has been fragmented and reduced by burning (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). Ratcliffe (1968) suggested that its original range extended throughout the north-west Highlands, from Ben Hope in the far north to Glencoe and perhaps Ben Cruachan in Argyll, with widespread representation, too, from Jura and Mull right through the Hebrides and round to Orkney and Shetland, in many of which localities it is now extremely scarce or unknown. There is also the possibility that, before the extensive clearance that has characterised the western Highlands, the Cal luna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath could be found among tracts of native pine forest. There is considerable floristic similarity between the community and the field and ground layers of the Scapania sub-community of the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland, something that is seen very well in the upper reaches of the forest remnants of Coille na Glas-Leitire above Loch Maree, although here, as in other more fragmentary examples, there is now an altitudinal gap between the woodland and the heath in the higher corries above. Distribution "
"h22","Zonation and succession The Vaccinium-Rubus heath is a widespread but local element of the sub-alpine zone in altitudinal transitions throughout the central and north-west Highlands, grading below to sub-montane heaths and mires and passing above to low-alpine sub-shrub vegetation and lichen-or moss-heaths. The amount of local shelter and duration of snow-lie play an important part in determining the patterns at higher levels, and at lower altitudes treatments influence the zonations, though for the most part this vegetation can be considered a climax community. The general context of the Vaccinium-Rubus heath throughout its range is among the middle reaches of the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, the major sub-shrub community of moist, base-poor soils at moderate to high altitudes through the cold and wet uplands. The two vegetation types come very close floristically and the former can be found as small patches in the latter or in more complex mosaics, the Vaccinium-Rubus heath picking out pockets of deeper, wetter peat on shadier slopes or where there is somewhat more prolonged snow-lie among the usually steeper and more rocky ground around (Figure 29). Species such as Blechnum, Cornus suecica, Plagiothecium undulatum, Sphagnum capillifolium, S. quinquefarium and Barbilophozia floer-kii occasionally find a place in the Hylocomium-Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath but their increase in the shift to the Vaccinium-Rubus heath, and the additional appearance of Rubus chamaemorus, is usually quite marked. In the north-west Highlands, where the Plagiothecium-Anastrepta sub community is the usual representative of the Vaccinium-Rubus heath in such zonations, the pattern may be complicated by the occurrence also of the Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath. In its general floristics, this community falls somewhere between the other two heath types, having an extensive carpet of hypnaceous mosses and Sphagna, but usually lacking C. suecica and R. chamaemorus, but additionally, where it occurs over the shadiest and most humid north-or east-facing slopes, it has the best representation of all these vege tation types of Atlantic hepatics which helps give it a very distinctive appearance among these mosaics. In the north-west Highlands, these sub-alpine heaths often give way over the lower gently-sloping ground of the foothills, where the peats become thicker and less freely-drained, to mire vegetation, characteristically of the Scirpus-Eriophorum type at lower altitudes in this oceanic region. Frequently, there is an intervening zone of Scirpus-Erica wet heath, the Vaccinium sub-communhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.066 Published online by Cambridge University Press588 Heaths ity of which, with its increased representation of sub shrubs and hypnaceous mosses, comes close in composition to the Vaccinium-Rubus heath. Patterns of this kind are especially typical of the lower slopes of Foina-ven and Ben More Assynt, An Teallach and the Affric-Cannich Hills (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). At higher altitudes in these parts of Scotland, the upward transition from the Vaccinium-Rubus heath is generally to sub-shrub vegetation in which Racomitrium lanuginosum plays an increasingly important part in the ground carpet. Over slopes that are not too exposed, the community usually passes above to the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath, in some stands of which there is an especially marked continuation of the abundance of hypnaceous mosses characteristic of the Vaccinium-Rubus heath (the Rhytidiadelphus-Hylocomium sub community), in others a local richness in Atlantic hepatics, where snow cover accentuates the shelter provided by shady aspect (the Bazzania-Mylia sub community). Often, though, the decisive shift to dominance in the sub-shrub canopy of V. myrtillus and E. nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum in the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath is accompanied by an associated vascular Figure 29. Transitions to chionophilous and tail-herb vegetation around snow-bed and crags in a heath/mire sequence in the north-west Scottish Highlands.

Over more windswept brows above patches of Vaccinium-Rubus heath, provided these are not at too inhospitably montane an altitude, Calluna can continue its dominance in association with such an assemblage as this. Such Calluna-Racomitrium heath is typically blown clear of any winter snow and has a dwarfed and windtrimmed mat of heather, presenting a very different appearance from the vegetation of more sheltered situations below. Arctostaphylos uva-ursi and A. alpinus sometimes figure in this kind of transition too, with the distinct Calluna-A. alpinus heath being separable at some sites. The upper slopes of Foinaven and Ben More Assynt are again classic sites for this kind of zonation, with more fragmentary examples being seen in the Monar Forest, on Beinn Eighe and the Fannich Hills. With the geographical move towards the south-east part of the Scottish Highlands, where the Polytrichum-Galium sub-community becomes the more widespread kind of Vaccinium-Rubus heath, the more oceanic kinds of low-alpine moss-heaths are replaced almost entirely by analogous vegetation types in which there is a predominance of lichens associated with abundant heather or bilberry and crowberry. Complex intermediate kinds of zonation are to be seen on Ben Wyvis but, over the slopes of the Cairngorms and around Clova, in the heart of the Grampians, the shift in the vegetation types is complete, stands of Vaccinium-Rubus heath giving way to either the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath, over moderately sheltered and snow-bound slopes at higher https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.066 Published online by Cambridge University PressH22 Vaccinium myrtillus-Rubus chamaemorus heath 589 altitudes, with a decisive move to overwhelming lichendominance in the mat, or, where there is a stronger influence of bitter winds, to the Calluna-Cladonia heath, transitions to which can be a little more gradual. At lower altitudes, too, through the Central Highlands, the zonations tend to be different from those in the northwest, the sub-alpine belt of heaths passing over the foothills to Calluna-Vaccinium heath and/or Calluna-A. uva-ursi heath, both of these often treated as grousemoor in this part of Scotland. The other very important feature of the vegetation patterns in which the Vaccinium-Rubus heath is found relates to the influence of longer snow-lie in the sub alpine zone, because here, and particularly in the Grampians, the community occurs as a mildly chionophilous vegetation type, marking out hollows or sheltered lee slopes or, where there is late persistence of snow, forming a surround to the bed. Typically, in the latter situations, it gives way under the deepest and longest snow cover, to some type of Nardus-Carex vegetation, the Typical or Empetrum-Cetraria sub-communities of which, with their patchy abundance of hypnaceous mosses beneath a sparse cover of bilberry, show some continuity with the Vaccinium-Rubus heath. Generally, however, the great increase in abundance of Nardus itself and/or of C. bigelowii, with the local prominence of Scirpus cespitosus and chionophilous mosses such as Dicranum fuscescens and Kiaeria starkei, serves to dis tinguish the central zone. Such patches, fringed above by a narrow arch of Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath and then, on the exposed upper lip, by a strip of Calluna-Cladonia heath, the whole embedded in a tract of Calluna-Er iophorum mire or low-alpine heath, are very characteristic of the Cairngorms (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). Even in such situations as these, there can be some influence on the vegetation pattern from grazing and burning which McVean & Ratcliffe (1962) suggested might facilitate the expansion of patches of Vaccinium-Rubus heath into a fringe of species-poor anthropogenic bilberry vegetation. And at lower altitudes, certainly, such treatments can greatly modify the context in which the community is found, burning of the drier sub-shrub vegetation tending to encourage the development of a patchwork of heather-dominated and impoverished heath, grazing tending to eliminate ericoids and transform the cover into first, a grassy heath of the Vaccinium-Deschampsia type, and then a Nardo-Galion sward. Distribution "
"h3","Zonation and succession The Ulex minor-Agrostis heath is typically found as part of soil-related sequences in which the degree of drainage impedence is the most important governing factor. Burning and grazing can modify these sequences and their intensity ultimately controls succession to woodland. Although such treatments continue in many stands, much heath vegetation of this kind has been lost by abandonment of traditional land use and soil improvement for agriculture or forestry so surviving tracts can be much fragmented and sharply delineated from their surrounds. Over more extensive stretches of heathland vegetation in central southern England, as in the New Forest where burning and grazing still maintain suites of sub-shrub communities over mosaics of different soil types, the Ulex minor-Agrostis heath occupies a distinct position on ground that is too dry for the Ericetum tetralicis wet heath and too moist for the Calluna-Ulex minor dry heath. In the former direction, an increased tendency for seasonal surface waterlogging in mineral soils is marked by the virtual extinction of U. minor, E. cinerea and A. curtisii, except in places where slight soligenous influence ameliorates the lack of aeration. Calluna, Molinia and E. tetralix maintain their frequency with the passage to the Ericetum, the last species especially benefiting from reduced competition from other sub shrubs. On these moister soils, too, species such as Scirpus cespitosus and Narthecium ossifragum, which are very rare in the Ulex minor-Agrostis heath, begin to make a frequent appearance with Sphagnum compactum https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.047 Published online by Cambridge University PressH3 Ulex minor-Agrostis curtisii heath 395 and S. tenellum becoming common in the ground layer. Such transitions as this are best seen around the margins of the elongated hollows that have been eroded into the sands and gravels of this part of Britain, the zonation sometimes continuing downslope over permanently-waterlogged ground with accumulating peat into the Narthecio-Sphagnetum valley bog. This is the kind of classic sequence described by Rose (1953) and New-bould (1960) and well shown around Cranesmoor, Denny, Wilverley and Holmsley bogs in the New Forest (Ratcliffe 1977). In the other direction, the move from gleyed podzols of various kinds on to sharply-draining humo-ferric podzols sees a disappearance from the vegetation of E. tetralix, Molinia and A. curtisii, with Calluna, E. cinerea and U. minor continuing and, together with Deschampsia flexuosa, making up the bulk of the cover of the Calluna-U. minor heath which terminates the sequence developed in relation to soil moisture. Away from the sharply-defined valley-mire hollows, the vegetation pat tern may be less well ordered and incomplete or with the drier or wetter elements prevailing according to local topography and hydrology. Over the landscape of the New Forest, for example, dry heath predominates over the well-drained slopes of Tertiary sands in the higher north-west with wetter heath restricted to ill-drained fragments of Plateau Gravel terraces; in the lower southern part of the area, damp heath is more abundant though most of the terraces are here better drained and have dry heath (Lambert & Manners 1964, Fisher 1915 a, b). And the pattern may be further complicated by the local pre-eminence of other edaphic factors where parent materials and soils change. Well-drained acid brown earths, for example, weathered from sandy or clay-sandy substrates, often have patches of the Pteri-dium-Galium community, and more fertile or disturbed ground, the Ulex-Rubus scrub, to which the Agrostis sub-community may grade, in the New Forest gorse 'brakes'. Although this part of Britain is quite exceptional in the extent to which it still retains large areas of these vegetation types disposed in extensive zonations, essentially the same mixture of communities is to be seen in the other major centre for the Ulex minor-Agrostis heath, around Poole Harbour. Here, on the Hartland-Arne and Studland-Godlingston heaths, originally con tinuous stretches of sub-shrub vegetation have been much fragmented (Moore 1962, Webb 1986), though there are the additional features of the presence of E. ciliaris in this and other communities and the striking juxtaposition of the heaths with open fresh-water and maritime vegetation types. In the long term, burning and grazing, which played a vital part in the development of this kind of open heath landscape, perhaps as early as the Mesolithic and cer tainly by the Bronze Age (e.g. Dimbleby 1962, Tubbs 1968, Haskins 1978, Webb 1986), are essential for its maintenance against succession to woodland. These treatments can confuse the soil-related boundaries between the heath types, as where burned or grazed areas cut across the major line of variation and favour the temporary expansion of some species common to more than one of the communities, such as E. cinerea or Molinia, or the more general long-term predominance of Calluna throughout. They can also mediate transitions to grasslands dominated by Molinia or A. curtisii, which can develop a stability of their own (e.g. Tubbs 1968). But their ultimate effect is repeatedly to set back invasion of trees, most characteristically on these soils both species of birch, Quercus robur and Pinus sylvestris, the last often abundantly represented in plantations established among stands of the community. Succession has not been followed but is likely to result in the development of drier Betula-Molinia woodland, usually dominated by poorly-grown birch. Under the rather open canopy typical of this community, Molinia persists in abundance with A. curtisii less shade-tolerant, and sub-shrubs usually confined to gaps. Distribution "
"h4","Zonation and succession The U. gallii-Agrostis heath is typically found in zonations with other heath communities and mires over sequences of soils which differ mainly in their moisture regime, occasionally in their base-richness. The particular sub-communities, and the other vegetation types, involved in these patterns vary with altitude and are throughout subject to modification by treatments. Throughout most of its range, such human interference has maintained this vegetation against progression to woodland, though abandonment of traditional treatments has in recent years often been a prelude to improvement for agriculture or forestry with permanent loss of the community. In its typical lowland setting, best seen now on the Devonshire Pebble-Bed commons, from the largest of which, at Aylesbeare, the vegetation pattern was des cribed by Ivimey-Cook et al. (1975), the U. gallii-Agrostis heath is found in very much the same general kind of sequence as is characteristic of stretches of impoverished acid soils further east, around Poole, in the New Forest and on the commons of Surrey and Sussex. Essentially, it replaces the U. minor-Agrostis heath as the intermediate component of the zonation from dry to wet heath developed over soils with an increasing tendency to surface-waterlogging, except that, in the wetter climate typical of this more westerly region, the contribution of the dry heath becomes proportionately less prominent. Generally, at these lower altitudes, the U. gallii-Agrostis heath is represented by the Erica tetralix sub-community and, as in the Aylesbeare transect (Ivimey-Cook et al. 1975), this can occupy the bulk of the less waterlogged ground. Where more sharply-draining acidic soils are present, however, it gives way to drier heath of the Calluna-Ulex gallii type, a community into which Calluna, E. cinerea and U. gallii run as consistent components but from which E. tetralix, Molinia and usually also A. curtisii are excluded. In the opposite direction, the U. gallii-Agrostis heath gives way to some kind of Ericetum tetralicis with the move to mineral soils with seasonal surface waterlogging. Here, it is Calluna, E. tetralix and Molinia which provide the major continuity of cover, although A. curtisii, E. cinerea and U. gallii can run some way into the wet heath if soligenous influence, even gentle flushing, maintains good aeration. Such more gradual transitions can be seen to some extent at Aylesbeare (Ivimey-Cook et al. 1975) but they are more obvious at some of the sites included in the NCC Devon Heathlands Report (1980), at Hares Down, for example. In the full sequence of vegetation types in this kind of site (Rose 1953), the zonation usually continues over permanently-waterlogged peat into the Narthecio-Sphagnetum valley bog and, over gently-undulating topography, the whole pat tern may be laid out as elongated, concentric zones. Often, however, the physiography is more complex than this and parent material heterogeneity can introduce further variations in the moisture or mineral regime. Commonly, as at Aylesbeare, there is some soligenous influence down the slopes such that Junco-Molinion vegetation intervenes through the zonation or, along soakways, the Schoenus-Narthecium mire can occur. And, as on heathlands in central southern England, deeper brown earth soils can have patches of the Pteri-dium-Galium community and on disturbed areas the Ulex-Rubus scrub. In such systems as these, the measure of base-enrichment is usually modest and dependent upon the con centration of sub-surface drainage waters from any local more calcareous substrates. On the Lizard, the U. gallii-Agrostis heath occurs in a rather different and peculiar situation, forming the most calcifuge element in a series of sub-shrub communities whose general character is controlled by the underlying serpentine and gabbro. Only where the dominating influence of these bedrocks is masked by acidic loess or Crousa Gravels are the soils sufficiently base-poor to support the U. gallii-Agrostis https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.048 Published online by Cambridge University PressH4 Ulex gallii-Agrostis curtisii heath 405 heath in this area, and from the deeper deposits, Erica vagans, the characteristic species through much of the Lizard heathland, is excluded. Around the thinner margins of the drift patches, however, it appears in a distinctive strip, usually 2-10 m wide, of the vegetation transitional to the E. vagans-Schoenus heath of the baserich gleys developed directly over the igneous parent materials (Coombe & Frost 1956tz, Hopkins 1983). On loess-contaminated brown earths, heath transitional to the other major sub-shrub community of the inland areas, the E. vagans-Ulex europaeus heath, can sometimes be found (Hopkins 1983). With the move to higher altitudes and a wetter climate, the Scirpus sub-community tends to replace the Erica sub-community and it can sometimes be found in the kind of dry-wet heath sequence typical of the lowlands, around the valley bogs of Dartmoor. On these upland fringes, however, there is a tendency for the whole character of the vegetation pattern to shift tow ards the sub-montane. In the first place, around the elongated topogenous hollows that drain radially across Figure 26. Zonations of heaths and mires on the lowland commons and moorland fringes of south-west England. H4c Ulex gallii-Agrostis heath, Erica sub-community H4d Ulex gallii-Agrostis heath, Scirpus sub-community H8b Calluna-Ulex gallii heath, Danthonia sub-community the fringes of Dartmoor, the Scirpus sub-community often gives way, on wetter ground, to some type of Scirpus-Erica wet heath or Junco-Molinion vegetation which then passes, in the water-tracks, to Carex echi-nata-Sphagnum mire, often rush-dominated. And, in the other direction, towards drier, sometimes rocky, ground, it is replaced by the Caluna-Vaccinium heath. Second, on a grander scale, the U. gallii-Agrostis heath makes a major contribution to the zone of marginal sub shrub vegetation that runs concentrically all around Dartmoor, grading above, through Scirpus-Erica wet heath to the Scirpus-Eriophorum blanket mire and pass ing below to Festuca-Agrostis grassland and improved pasture (Figure 26). Similar gross landscape patterns, though not so intact or clear, can be seen over the other major upland areas of the south-west, Bodmin Moor and Exmoor, and they reflect the tendency, in the more humid climate, for gentle slopes to accumulate a mantle of ombrogenous peat and for wet and dry heath to be pushed on to the steeper margins. But there is also a strong element of M15d Scirpus-Erica wet heath, Vaccinium sub-community Ml6a Ericetum tetralicis wet heath, Typical sub-community Ml7a Scirpus-Eriophorum mire, Drosera-Sphagnum sub-community M2 la Narthecio-Sphagnetum mire, Sphagnum-Rhynchospora sub-community M21a https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.048 Published online by Cambridge University Press406 Heaths cultural influence in the zonations, with sub-shrub vegetation becoming confined to a narrow belt of relatively unimproved land, edaphically impoverished and sometimes topographically intractable, above the limit of more intensive agriculture. Traditionally around these upland fringes, the heath zone has provided low-grade pasture, periodically renewed by burning, so it is often the Festuca sub-community that occurs in these kinds of zonations. And, in such situations, it is very obvious that grazing can mediate a conversion from U. gallii-Agrostis heath in which sub-shrubs predominate, through the grass-heath of this sub-community to calcifugous grassland of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium type. The upland margins in the south-west often consist of ill-defined mosaics of these vegetation types (e.g. Ward et al. 1972«) and enclosures below frequently contain improved pas ture which has been derived from the heath and grassland by further treatment, liming, fertilising and top sowing, which can effect a fairly ready conversion to calcifuge types of Lolio-Cynosuretum. Injudicious graz ing can, however, create problems along the way, permitting the spread of Nardus stricta, for example, or Pteridium. On Dartmoor, the pasturing of the heaths by mixed herds of cattle, sheep and ponies may help keep these in check: ponies nibble out the centre of Nardus tussocks (Havinden & Wilkinson 1970) and cattle can trample out spreading bracken (Sayer 1969). Careless burning, too, can precipitate a run-down of the U. gallii-Agrostis heath. The spread of A. curtisii, a relatively unpalatable grass (Ivimey-Cook 1959, Ward et al. 1972«), is a common problem in newly-burned heaths, and with frequent fires it may become more or less permanently dominant in vegetation of the Agrostis-Erica type. In other cases, Molinia may become very abundant in a shift to Junco-Molinion vegetation. And, even where there is regeneration of the sub-shrubs, repeated burning can impoverish the cryptogam flora, and uncontrolled fires destroy the characteristic mosaic of dominance seen in well-managed swales. Through most of its range, however, burning and grazing have been essential to the maintenance of the vegetation against progression to woodland. Except in situations like the Lizard, where exposure to high and frequent winds is combined with a general scarcity of seed-parents, invasion of shrubs and trees occurs readily in the absence of treatments. Patchy development of the Ulex-Rubus scrub is often seen over disturbed ground in the U. gallii-Agrostis heath, along trackways, field margins and the edges of plantations, but of greater long-term significance is colonisation by birch which can fairly quickly form an open canopy to developing Betula-Molinia woodland. Very commonly, however, the abandonment of traditional treatments in the low lands has been followed eventually by improvement and conversion of the land to pasture or plantation.Distribution "
"h5","Zonation and succession The E. vagans-Schoenus heath forms a major component of the mosaic of sub-shrub communities and other https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.049 Published online by Cambridge University PressH5 Erica vagans-Schoenus nigricans heath 417 vegetation types developed on the Lizard in relation to variations in soil moisture, base-status and trophic level and the amount of salt-spray deposition. The pattern of past and present treatments often influences the effect of these factors; and burning and, to a lesser extent, grazing still also play a major role in maintaining the community in its typical form. One of the more gradual kinds of transitions is found where the soils retain the generally wet and base-rich character associated with the E. vagans-Schoenus heath, but seem to become somewhat more fertile with, in particular, increased availability of phosphate (Hopkins 1983), a feature which may reflect a switch in bedrock from serpentine to gabbro and somewhat less lengthy winter flooding, but which can also be associated with disturbance alongside walls, ditches and roadways. Then the community is replaced by the Molinia-Poten-tilla mire in which Schoenus can retain some representation, but where dominance shifts markedly to Molinia, with E. vagans, E. tetralix and U. gallii still present quite frequently but usually exceeded in abundance by U. europaeus, its bushes rooted in the often very large Molinia tussocks. Among the associates, such distinctive smaller herbs as Anagallis tenella, Carex pulicaris and Festuca ovina are usually overwhelmed by the accumulation of thick Molinia litter, and taller plants like Serratula and Succisa are replaced by Angelica sylvestris and Eupatorium cannabinum. In such vegetation on the Lizard (which Hopkins (1983) included within the E. vagans-Schoenus heath as a Ulex variant), the climate is sufficiently mild for Cladium to gain a local hold in sites which are flooded only for very brief periods, as in the Kynance valleys, on Goon-hilly Down and at Main Dale. Elsewhere, increased abundance and vigour of Cladium and the appearance of Phragmites on permanently-flooded soils along stream sides and in hollows marks a continuation of the zonation into sedge-dominated Phragmites-Eupatorium fen or Cladietum marisci swamp. In other places, the E. vagans-Schoenus heath grades more directly to fen vegetation through the Eleocharis sub-community, Phragmites becoming more abundant and vigorous in ungrazed transitions. Except where Cladium is over whelmingly dominant, the Molinia-Potentilla mire and fens of such sequences seem to be more susceptible to shrub invasion than the E. vagans-Schoenus heath itself, perhaps because of their more eutrophic soils and, in the absence of burning, they are readily colonised by Salix cinerea to form stands of the Salix-Galium woodland (Hopkins 1983). In other situations, the passage to the Molinia-Potentilla mire can denote a transition, over the lower flushed slopes of the shallow valleys that wind through the interior of the headland, to the E. vagans-Ulex heath, the community centred on the more free-draining base-rich brown earths of shedding ground on the serpentine and gabbro. In the Molinia sub-community of that kind of heath, typical of slightly gleyed profiles above the limit of seasonal inundation, Schoenus is reduced to low cover and Molinia, though abundant, is not strongly tussocky. In addition to E. vagans, E. tetralix and U. gallii remain frequent and Serratula tinctoria and Stachys betonica occur occasionally. But, again, U. europaeus becomes very common and prominent and, on the somewhat drier ground, there is an increase in E. cinerea and Calluna. Among the herbs, the appearance of Sangui-sorba officinalis and Viola riviniana is the most obvious indication of the switch from one community to another. This vegetation may in turn give way to Typical E. vagans-Ulex heath over free-draining brown earths with local patches of Ulex-Rubus scrub or Prunus scrub where freedom from burning has permitted invasion of other woody plants. By and large, it is through a zone of the E. vagans-Ulex heath that the E. vagans-Schoenus heath grades to the maritime Calluna-Scilla heath of the coastal cliff-top fringe. Locally, however, in very sheltered situations, the E. vagans-Schoenus heath can itself be found in cliff-top flushes, though it should be noted that such vegetation is different in composition from the Sc/zoeww^-dominated flushes found in exposed situations near the foot of cliffs on the Lizard: these are best placed in the Festuca-Daucus grassland. More frequent than transitions to drier, base-rich soils, many of which, at least on the gabbro, are now cultivated and thus marked by an abrupt switch to improved grassland, are zonations to the base-poor and somewhat better-drained profiles developed from the loess and Crousa Gravels which are superimposed over the ultrabasic bedrocks. Characteristically, such soils are occupied by the Ulex gallii-Agrostis heath which thus forms irregular patches on the gentle interfluves of the peninsula, surrounded and broken up by stretches of the E. vagans-Schoenus heath. Over the margins of less well-defined areas of superficials, where the cover thins gradually or where loess or gravel has been mixed with the underlying base-rich parent material in bouts of past cultivation, the transition between the two heath types is correspondingly indistinct with E. vagans, Serratula and Sanguisorba officinalis running into the U. gallii-Agrostis heath in a marginal zone 2-10 m wide (Hopkins 1983). In other cases, steeper-edged banks of loess or gravel show an abrupt replacement of the one heath by the other, E. vagans and Schoenus both disappearing, together with most of their herbaceous associates, E. cinerea, Calluna and Agrostis curtisii increasing in fre quency and cover to become co-dominant with the E. tetralix, U. gallii and Molinia. This basic soil-related pattern has been affected by treatments in a variety of ways. Some activities, strongly controlled by the natural drainage quality or fertility of the ground, have had a more ordered impact which has https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.049 Published online by Cambridge University Press418 Heaths often confirmed the edaphic influence, as in the case of 'turf' stripping, largely confined to the humic stagno-gleys of the serpentine and gabbro, or the primitive shifting cultivation of the past which seems to have been concentrated on the thinner deposits of loess and over the more nutrient-rich brown earths on the gabbro. Enclosure for grazing and the present pattern of burning, on the other hand, cut across the edaphic boundaries, so their effects can confuse the zonations described above. Fires, for example, particularly severe summer burns, can impose a structural uniformity within a tract of heathland, whose soil-related mosaic may take some years to grow out again. Within the communities of wetter soils here, Molinia is the plant likely to become temporarily dominant across such boundaries following fires, though on the poorer soils its vigour is reduced. Burning, with subsequent severe grazing, especially on more eutrophic soils or ones enriched with fertilisers, is likely to convert the E. vagans-Schoenus heath (and wetter stands of the E. vagans-Ulex and U. gallii-Agrostis heaths) into Molinia-Potentilla mire. For the most part, however, burning, sometimes combined with grazing in the enclosures, has the effect of maintaining the different sub-shrub communities in a complex patchwork of vegetation in various stages of cyclical regeneration. Except on the most infertile soils, such treatments probably play some part in setting back the invasion of shrubs and trees though, over much of the headland, the scarcity of seed-parents and exposure to severe winds militate against rapid development of scrub and woodland. On the wetter soils, the natural eventual successor to the E. vagans-Schoenus heath is probably Salix-Galium woodland or Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland; on seasonally-waterlogged pro files, some kind of Betula-Molinia woodland seems a likely development. Distribution "
"h6","Zonation and succession The community occurs in mosaics and zonations in the open and enclosed heaths of the Lizard where transitions can be related to variations in soil moisture, basestatus and trophic level and the amount of salt-spray deposition. The effects of burning and, to some extent, grazing are superimposed on to these patterns and, except in extreme edaphic and climatic conditions, these factors probably play an important part in maintaining the sub-shrub vegetation against successional change. The floristic contrasts between the two major kinds of E. vagans heath, the E. vagans-Ulex and the E. vagans-Schoenus types, developed in relation to the degree of drainage impedence in base-rich soils, is sometimes expressed as a zonation between the communities, over ground that becomes more gently sloping and more prone to seasonal waterlogging within the shallow drainage basins and over the undulating surface of the plateau itself. In such situations, the Molinia sub community of the E. vagans-Ulex heath may form a transition zone between the vegetation types, E. tetralix and Molinia appearing first, then Schoenus increasing in frequency, but U. europaeus maintaining its cover quite well. Then, with the move into the E. vagans-Schoenus heath, the latter fades, together with many of the attendant herbs, and Schoenus and Molinia begin to show the strongly-tussocky structure typical of seasonally-inundated ground, E. cinerea and Calluna becoming confined to the tussocks and the runnels developing their characteristic rich flora. Sometimes, where there is a switch from serpentine to gabbro or in sites where there has been some disturbance, the Molinia-Potentilla mire may occur within such sequences. In such veg etation, Molinia is strongly dominant over the somewhat more fertile soils, but Schoenus can be found occasionally and both E. vagans and U. europaeus can occur rooted in the tussocks. Separating this kind of vegetation from transitional heath stands can present some difficulties. The other quite common type of gradual zonation occurs where the base-rich parent materials which give rise to the free-draining brown earths supporting E. vagans-Ulex heath are overlain by banks of acid loess. Where contamination with such aeolian material is only slight, the Agrostis sub-community is characteristic but this can give way to U. gallii-Agrostis heath over deeper deposits. Then E. vagans peters out fairly quickly, U. europaeus becomes confined to disturbed areas and the fairly rich assemblage of associates is replaced by a restricted suite of more calcifugous plants. Neither the U. gallii-Agrostis nor the E. vagans-Schoenus heaths are often found running continuously up to the maritime heath zone of the Lizard because the soils of which they are most characteristic are mainly confined to the inner parts of the peninsula. On more fertile gabbro and schist soils, moreover, the maritime sequence is often truncated above the Calluna-Scilla heath by cultivated land bounded by an enclosure wall. On the serpentine, however, where the soils are more oligotrophic, the zonation can run uninterrupted from the maritime heath on to the plateau. In such transitions, which are especially well developed on the more exposed west coast of the Lizard and, more locally, around the cove valleys, the E. vagans-Ulex heath typically occupies a position inland of the Calluna-Scilla heath. E. vagans, which is mildly salt-tolerant, can extend some way in to the Viola sub-community of the maritime heath, though the gorse spp., particularly U. europaeus, become much patchier with increasing exposure until eventually it is Calluna and E. cinerea that are providing the bulk of an often stunted and wind-pruned sub-shrub cover. But, apart from the appearance of Plantago maritima, there is considerable continuity between the herbaceous ele ment of the Festuca sub-community of the E. vagans-Ulex heath, the usual cliff-top type, and the Viola sub community of the Calluna-Scilla heath, with species like Festuca ovina, Scilla verna, Viola riviniana, Carexflacca, C. caryophyllea, Polygala vulgaris, Koeleria macrantha, Plantago lanceolata, Hypochoeris radicata, Lotus corni-culatus and Thymus praecox all occurring in both. Genista pilosa can be quite a good marker of the transition and both Coombe & Frost (1956a) and Hopkins (1983) used this species to name the vegetation of this intermediate zone. Where the zonation continues inland from the E. vagans-Ulex heath into the E. vagans-Schoenus and U. gallii-Agrostis types, the sequences constitute some of the most extensive and valuable tracts of coastal sub-shrub vegetation that we have. On the rocky cliff tops, where parching of the soils in spring and summer, inherent infertility, exposure to wind and grazing all contribute to the inhospitable character of the environment, the Festuca sub-community may represent a natural climax kind of E. vagans-Ulex heath (Hopkins 1983). In other situations, how ever, it is burning and grazing which ultimately maintain the vegetation as a plagioclimax, though the poor quality of the serpentine soils and the shortage of seed parents over much of the headland would probably make succession to scrub slow. As noted above, older stands of the community do show some transitional features to Ulex-Rubus or Prunus scrubs, though Coombe & Frost (1956a) considered that progression from heath to the latter was not clearly supported by field evidence. Distribution "
"h7","Zonation and succession The Calluna-Scilla heath is characteristically found in zonations developed over maritime cliffs in relation to gradients of salt-spray deposition and soil moisture, themselves complex functions of exposure and cliff physiography. Bedrock type also has an important influence on soil development, the disposition and character of the profiles, and these factors, together with regional variations in climate, affect the vegetation sequences. Grazing can alter zonations and, together with exposure, may prevent successional change. Agricultural improvement, particularly around our southern coasts, has often abruptly truncated the zonations inland, sometimes totally obliterating the heath zone. Except over limestones, from which the Calluna-Scilla heath is usually absent and where ericoid vegetation of any kind is typically limited to drift-contaminated slopes set back some way from the sea, the community forms the inner limit of maritime vegetation. Generally speaking, in the southern part of Britain, where grazing is light or absent, it is replaced to seaward by the Festuca-Holcus grassland, which can experience up to twice as much salt-spray deposition. Over basic bedrocks, as on the serpentine, gabbro and hornblende schists of the Lizard and on basalt or calcareous mudstones and shales in Dyfed, Gwynedd, Cumbria and Galloway & Dumfries, the Calluna-Scilla heath is typically represented by the Viola sub-community over soils which are reasonably deep and moist. To seaward, over more exposed and shallower profiles, this passes to the Dactylis sub-community of the Festuca-Holcus grassland or, where soil moisture is maintained, as over north-facing slopes for example, to the Primula sub community. The seaward limit of the heath is usually well marked by the edge of the sub-shrub canopy but, where the wind keeps this very low, the boundary may be scarcely visible from a distance except as a slight tonal difference. And, of course, there is considerable floristic continuity through species like Festuca rubra, Holcus lanatus, Plantago lanceolata, P. maritima, Lotus corniculatus, Scilla verna, Daucus carota ssp. gummifer, Hypochoeris radicata, and Viola riviniana. Within the heath zone itself, there is often a mosaic over more base-rich soils between the Viola sub community and the Armeria type according to the distribution of deeper and shallower profiles (Figure 27). And where rock outcrops break the mantle, the zonation may continue to the Armeria-Cerastium community, where the sub-shrubs and mesophytic herbs disappear and therophytes and succulents become prominent. These vegetation types can also form a more ordered zonation running down cliffs where the soils become progressively discontinuous but, in complex topography, it may be very difficult to demarcate their limits. In this southern part of Britain, the sequence of communities is often terminated landwards at the level of the Calluna-Scilla heath by the boundary of the improved cliff-top grassland but, in a few places, the zonation continues inland to non-maritime heaths. The most extensive patterns of this kind are to be seen on the Lizard, though they are of a rather unusual type because of the local importance there of E. vagans. This, together with occasional U. europaeus, can run into the Viola sub community a little way but, on the free-draining, baserich brown earths of the cliff-top slopes and around the cove valleys, these two sub-shrubs become co-dominant above the Calluna-Scilla zone in the E. vagans-Ulex heath. Over the Lizard hinterland, this then gives way to the E. vagans-Schoenus heath over base-rich gleys or the U. gallii-Agrostis heath on base-poor, free-draining soils over acidic superficials. Essentially similar patterns of Festuca-Holcus grassland, Calluna-Scilla heath and inland heath can be seen over ungrazed cliffs cut into neutral or acid bedrocks which are of widespread occurrence up the west coast of Britain but particularly important on Land's End, where granite occurs, on the north Cornish and Dyfed coasts, where sandstones and shales crop out, and in Anglesey with its Pre-Cambrian rocks. Here, the Calluna sub-community is the usual Calluna-Scilla heath of deeper, free-draining soils, passing seawards into the Achillea or Plantago sub-communities of the Festuca-Holcus grassland, the sub-shrubs again fading at the transition but Festuca rubra, Holcus lanatus, Plantago spp., Scilla verna, Rumex acetosa and Potentilla erecta continuing throughout. Again, the Armeria sub community can occur patchily within the Calluna type on areas of shallower soil and mark a transition to the Armeria-Cerastium therophyte vegetation, or form a seaward transition to this or Festuca-Armeria grassland. Landward continuations are once more rare but, in some localities, the sequence passes into the Scilla sub community of the Calluna-U. gallii heath. Where such southern zonations are subject to grazing, the basic pattern of heath and grassland remains, though heavy herbivore pressure may reduce the height of the sub-shrubs further, making the boundary even harder to see, or actually move it inland somewhat where palatable species, notably Calluna, are eaten out completely. Also, the Festuca-Holcus grassland is often represented just by the Plantago sub-community or is totally replaced by the Festuca-Plantago grassland, the abundance of Plantago spp. running into the heath. In northern Britain, where grazing is more widespread, this kind of pattern is very common, the Festuca-Plantago grassland occupying the bulk of the more accessible cliff slopes with its Armeria, Carex and Schoenus sub-communities distributed according to decreasing maritime influence and increasing soil moisture. Any of these can grade into the Calluna-Scilla heath above, though in this region, of course, the sub-communities tend to be different: on drier, shallower soils the Calluna type is characteristic, the Empetrum on somewhat deeper mineral profiles and the Erica on wet mineral soils or peat. All these kinds of Calluna-Scilla heath persist on ungrazed cliffs in the north, though the Calluna sub-community seems particularly common there and, with relaxation of herbivore pressure, the Festuca-Plantago grassland tends to be replaced by the Festuca-Holcus grassland, often in this part of Britain by the Anthoxanthum sub-community, an abundance of Nardo-Galion herbs running throughout. Once more, on both grazed and ungrazed cliffs, the Armeria sub community of the Calluna-Scilla heath can mark shal lower soils under strong maritime influence though it tends to be scarce in the wet climate. And the Viola sub community is likewise rather local, picking out areas of mull soils over more base-rich substrates. Although, in some parts of Scotland the typical southern pattern of enclosure to the cliff edge is quite common, in the west, the Calluna-Scilla heath is often contiguous with inland semi-natural vegetation which, in the wet climate of this part of Britain, is usually Ericion tetralicis wet heath or Erico-Sphagnion blanket mire on peats which thicken up to a continuous deep mantle on inland slopes. Typically, the Erica or, on drier ground, the Empetrum, sub-community of the heath grades to the Scirpus-Erica wet heath or the Scirpus-Eriophorum bog, the various sub-shrubs maintaining their cover but the herbaceous component of the heath passing to a Molinia or Scirpus-dominated suite of associates. On steeper ground where, even in this humid climate, the peat mantle has not been able to accumulate, the Calluna sub-community of the heath usually passes to Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland devoid of sub-shrubs and maritime species. In sheltered situations on the upper reaches of cliffs, particularly in the south, the Calluna-Scilla heath can give way laterally to bracken or scrub, often with a fringe of the Festuca-Hyacinthoides grassland or rank Arrhenatheretum, and such vegetation often runs inland through the heath zone up head-filled gullies. The main woody colonisers in such situations are U. europaeus on drier, more acidic soils and Prunus spinosa on moister mulls and, where exposure is not too severe, grazing may play some part in preventing these species gaining a hold in the Calluna-Scilla heath. In many cases, however, susceptibility to even small amounts of salt-spray hinders their invasion into the community, so over much of its range this vegetation can be considered a climatic climax. Distribution "
"h8","Zonation and succession The Calluna-U. gallii heath is found in diverse kinds of zonations and mosaics with other vegetation types in relation to differences in the moisture content, base richness and trophic state of the soils, and to variation in local climatic conditions, most strikingly maritime influence. Burning and grazing can modify these pat terns but they also produce effects of their own, being responsible in most situations for the maintenance of the vegetation against succession to woodland. Reclama tion of land for improved agriculture has left many stands as fragments in pastoral landscapes. Towards the south-western part of its range, the community can occur as the dry-heath component in the characteristic sequences of sub-shrub vegetation developed over acidic soils with varying degrees of drainage impedence. Essentially, it replaces the Calluna-U. minor heath on the free-draining profiles in such zonations in the region to the west of the Poole basin, which marks the general divide between the ranges of U. minor and U. gallii (Proctor 1965). In full sequences of this type, the Calluna-U. gallii heath gives way, over gleyed podzols and stagnogleys, developed where an argillic B horizon or iron pan impedes drainage, to the U. gallii-Agrostis heath. U. gallii, E. cinerea and Calluna all run on, often in considerable abundance, into this community, but the junction between the two is usually marked by the consistent appearance of E. tetralix, Molinia and A. curtisii, which typically share dominance with them. In other cases, where there is a more sudden switch to mineral soils that are strongly seasonally waterlogged, the zonation can pass directly to some kind of Ericetum tetralicis. In this kind of wet heath, E. cinerea is scarce and U. gallii generally confined to sites with some through-put and aeration, so the junction is often quite clearly marked with a shift in dominance to Calluna, E. tetralix and Molinia. In fact, within the tracts of heaths in south-western Britain, the Calluna-U. gallii type occupies a relatively small proportion of the ground, even where more free-draining soils are quite extensive. On the Devonshire Pebble-Bed commons, for example, where gently-dissected Triassic deposits form an undulating dip slope (Ivimey-Cook et al. 1975), on the Devon and Gower commons over Carboniferous deposits (NCC Devon Heathland Report 1980, NCC Gower Common unpublished data) and in Pembrokeshire, where suites of sub shrub communities occur on the plateau cut into Cambrian and Ordovician rocks (NCC Pembrokeshire Heaths Report 1981), this community is rather poorly represented. This is partly because, with the increasing wetness of the climate in moving to the west and into the upland fringes, the damper kinds of heath are able to extend much further on to the free-draining profiles kept continually moist by high precipatiomevaporation ratios. Often, then, it is the U. gallii-Agrostis heath that occupies the brown podzolic soils or podzols or, beyond its range, some drier kind of Ericetum tetralicis, with the Calluna-U. gallii heath confined to small stands over knolls and around rock outcrops. Even where tracts of dry heath could be potentially more extensive, the free-draining soils on lowland commons have often been the focus of past disturbance or cultivation, such that they now support Ulex-Rubus scrub or Pteridium-Galium vegetation. Even where the effects of human activity have not been so gross as this, treatments can mask the contribution of the Calluna-U. gallii heath to zonations such as these. Where burning occurs, for example, swales often cut across the soil-related boundaries and develop a temporary prominence of regenerating U. gallii or E. cinerea, or an eventual dominance of Calluna, which masks variation in the associated floras of the different constituent heaths. In other cases, burning can be followed by a great expansion in the cover of A. curtisii or Molinia, centred on the moister soils, but often extending on to the more free-draining profiles: extensive, fire-climax stands of Molinia-Potentilla grassland are a marked feature among heath sequences in lowland western Britain. Grazing may contribute to the maintenance of this kind of rank species-poor sward by helping keep the various regenerating sub-shrubs in check but frequently, in zonations of this kind, it produces a different kind of convergence among the associated herbaceous floras of the various heaths, to form extensive stretches of fairly uniform, close-cropped grassland. In the south-west, the most widespread kinds of Cal-luna-U. gallii heath are the Danthonia and Vaccinium types, the former especially on warmer and drier slopes, the latter in moister, cooler situations. These vegetation types already show a strong measure of floristic continuity in their herbs with some of the damper heaths, particularly the Festuca sub-community of the U. gallii-Agrostis heath and the Succisa-Carex sub-community of the Ericetum tetralicis. The effect of grazing over the boundary between the former and the Calluna-U. gallii heath is well seen in the sequence of heaths and grassheaths described from the Dartmoor fringes by Ward et al. (1972«) and some perplexing intermediates between the Calluna-U. gallii heath and the Ericetum are to be seen on certain Pembrokeshire heaths (NCC Pembrokeshire Heaths Report 1981). The floristic character of the swards derived by graz ing the heath vegetation of the Danthonia and Vaccinium sub-communities places them firmly within the Nardo-Galion: they are characterised by mixtures of such grasses as Agrostis capillaris, A. canina ssp. montana, Festuca ovina, F. rubra, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Dan thonia decumbens, Nardus stricta with Carex pilulifera, Potentilla erecta and Galium saxatile, that is, exactly the herbaceous element of the runnels between the sub shrubs in the heath itself. Grazing can mediate every gradation between the extremes of dense heath on the one hand and continuous grassy sward on the other, and is the major factor controlling the other common kind of zonation in which the community is found: heath/ grassland mosaics over stretches of more or less uniformly free-draining acid soil. These are a particularly characteristic feature of poorer-quality grazing land over acid rocks and superficials around the upland fringes, where the bulk of the sward can usually be referred to some kind of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grass land and where the heath forms patches of varying size and organisation over rocky knolls, around field margins and in neglected corners, sometimes even forming hedgerow vegetation on top of inaccessible earth banks. Improvement of the pasture by the application of farmyard manure (or, perhaps, simply a switch from sheep to cattle as the grazing stock) may succeed in converting the sward to a more mesophytic kind, and use of chemical fertilisers, with top-sowing, can readily effect a full transformation to the Lolio-Cynosuretum. Towards the limit of in-by land in farms along the margins of Dartmoor and the Welsh upland, such pasture is the frequent context for remaining fragments of the Calluna-U. gallii heath. Variations in base-richness, as well as in the trophic state of the soils, can produce a further element of complexity in these grazing-related sequences over free-draining profiles. As noted earlier, the community can occur over calcareous substrates where these are mantled by a cover of pervious, more base-poor superficials and on sites like the Mendip (Hope-Simpson & Willis 1955), the South Gower coast (NCC South Gower Coast Report 1981) and the Great Orme in Gwynedd (Rodwell 1974), the Calluna-U. gallii heath serves as one effective marker of the location of brown earths derived from patches of exotics such as loess or aeolian sand deposited and retained over gentler slopes (Smithson 1953, Perrin 1956, Ball 1960, Findlay 1965; see also Pigott 1962, 1970«). Typically, in such sites, the heath is surrounded by a calcicolous sward, in this case, the Festuca-Avenula grassland, developed over thin, dry and highly calcareous rendzina soils on the native limestone, and, where the patches of superficials are sharply defined, there can be an abrupt switch from this to the Danthonia sub-community of the heath: this kind of pattern can sometimes be seen where the exotic parent materials have filled up crevices, together with long-weathered and decalcified limestone debris, in the underlying rock surface. Often, however, there is a gradual transition from the rendzinas to the brown earths, with a continuous increase in the soil depth and in the proportion of non-native parent materials, pro ducing some very interesting zonations from the calcicolous sward through to the heath. It is in such situations that the Sanguisorba sub-community occurs as an intermediate between the two, sometimes grading directly to the Festuca-Avenula grassland, in other cases showing a further transitional zone which can be classified within the Festuca-Agrostis grassland. Mixtures of calcicoles and calcifuges are characteristic of this intermediate kind of vegetation, together with some other species such as Stachys betonica, Hypericum pulchrum and, in Wales and Derbyshire, Viola lutea (Balme 1953, 1954, Pigott 1962, Grime 1963«, b). The term 'limestone heath' is often used to describe it, or part of it, but it should be noted that such transitional vegetation can occur in zonations and mosaics between other constituent grasslands and heaths. The clarity of such pat terns, though ultimately dependent upon the edaphic variation, is also much affected by the grazing intensity: relaxation allows most of the calcicolous plants to be overwhelmed by coarse grasses of broad ecological tolerance and perhaps permits an expansion of the sub shrubs on to somewhat more base-rich soils which they can acidify (e.g. Grubb et al. 1969). One further environmental variable, which can exert a controlling influence on zonations involving the Calluna-U. gallii heath, is salt-spray deposition. Over tracts of pervious, acidic rocks and superficials, the improvement of deeper profiles has been so extensive that, in some parts of south-west Britain, the community is now confined to the unenclosed fringe of land along the cliff tops, where it is represented by the Scilla type. However, as mentioned earlier, it is only on those parts of cliffs which are reasonably sheltered from salt-laden winds that even this kind of sub-shrub vegetation can survive and quite commonly it represents the limit of the seminatural zonation, being terminated abruptly above by a field boundary with improved pasture or arable beyond. To seaward, where heath vegetation runs on into the more maritime zone, there is a transition to the Calluna-Scilla heath: typically, over more acidic soils, this is of the Calluna sub-community, from which U. gallii is absent and where Armeria maritima and Plantago cor-onopus occasionally figure, but which otherwise shows considerable continuity in its floristics, something which is readily seen where the sub-shrub element is reduced by exposure to winds to a very short mat through which the herbs inter-pene träte. Beyond this, the sequence can continue through maritime grasslands of the Festuca-Holcus and Festuca-Armeria types, with the Festuca-Plantago grassland becoming prominent where grazing is particularly heavy and then to maritime crevice com munities. Throughout, the zonation can be interrupted by patches of the Armeria-Cerastium vegetation over rock outcrops or ant-hills, whose flora can show some continuity with the heath through species such as Jasione montana and Air a praecox. Such sequences are especially characteristic of the Cornish granite, the sandstones and shales of the north Cornish coast and Dyfed and the Anglesey Pre-Cambrian cliffs. In certain areas, the Scilla sub-community is open to grazing stock though, within the range of the Calluna-U. gallii heath, it is frequently beef cattle rather than sheep that are turned on to sea-cliffs and their less assiduous cropping does not have such a marked effect on the vegetation. But, even without such treatment, the invasion of shrubs and trees into this kind of Calluna-U. gallii heath is probably much hindered by exposure to wind and modest amounts of salt-spray and it can perhaps be considered a climax vegetation. In more sheltered situations, episodes of heavy grazing with scuffing of the ground or fires can both open up the ground in the short term and allow establishment of seedlings but, for shrubs and trees to get away, such treatments must then be withdrawn. Successions have not been followed in any detail but the most likely woody invaders on the more base-poor soils are birch and oak (with a tendency for Betula pubescens and Quercus petraea to be pre-eminent in the areas of wetter climate), with Pinus sylvestris able to seed in from plantations, and Sorbus aucuparia and Ilex aquifoliunv. such developments would be expected to culminate in Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland. Where the pro files are not so acid, impoverished or excessively draining, it is possible that thorn scrub might develop as a precursor to more mixed oak-birch woodland of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus or Quercus-Betula-Oxalis types. Along such a successional line, the early establishment of Ulex-Rubus or Pteridium-Rubus underscrub may be of considerable importance in breaking the dominance of the calcifuge sub-shrubs and initiating some measure of soil enrichment. Disturbance could provide the initiating step in such a process and the presence of fragmentary scrubby woodland around abandoned settlements and wartime emplacements bears some testimony to this. Where Pteridium is locally established, however, any opening of the heath canopy, either by disturbance or by degeneration of the bushes, may allow it to pre-empt the ground forming dense bracken stands. Distribution "
"h9","Zonation and succession The Calluna-Deschampsia heath can be found in zonations and mosaics with wet-heath and mire vegetation where the major influence on floristic variation is natural differences in the moisture content of suites of base-poor and oligotrophic soils. Even in such situations, however, the effects of such factors as burning, grazing and draining complicate the patterns of vegetation types and, in many cases, these are of overriding importance, their effects being especially clearly seen over more uniform tracts of soils, where patchworks of the community, with grasslands and woodlands, represent stages in regeneration and succession. Neglect of tra ditional treatments has seen extensive invasion by trees at some sites, particularly in the lowlands, though it is there, too, that previously large tracts of heath and woodland have been most assiduously reclaimed for agriculture. In other cases, both in the lowlands and around the upland fringes, the community has been replaced by coniferous plantations. In a few sites, the Calluna-Deschampsia heath forms the dry-heath component in the classic kind of lowland valley-mire zonation that is so characteristic of central southern and south-west Britain, occurring over the most free-draining of the sequence of acidic soils dis posed around elongated hollows through which there is concentration of ground waters draining from the sur rounds or from particular springs and flushes. Even through the lowland parts of the range of the community, the climate is not sufficiently oceanic to see the transgression of Erica tetralix and Molinia on to more free-draining soils, so a humid heath zone, such as is typical of these patterns in the more Atlantic parts of the country, is lacking, and there is generally a sharper shift, over ground that shows increasingly strong gleying, to the Ericetum tetralicis wet heath, where these two species can have ascendancy over Calluna', and then, where there is continuous stagnation more or less to the surface, with accumulation of peat proper, the vegetation changes to the Narthecio-Sphagnetum bog. This kind of pattern can still be seen in parts of Cannock Chase, developed around the valleys incised into the Bunter sandstones, pebble-beds and breccias (Ratcliffe 1977), but, though the systems are hydrologically similar to those of, say, the New Forest, the flora is, throughout the sequence, of a more impoverished character. Both the Ericetum and Narthecio-Sphagnetum are approaching their geographical limits in this part of Britain and, over the drier ground, generations of burning and disturbance have much reduced the Sphagnum component of the wet heath and favoured a general abundance of heather throughout, thus blurring the boundaries between the communities. More recently, wholesale lowering of the water-table, probably as a result of coal-mining beneath the Chase, is drying out the mire systems there, eliminating the wetter elements or causing them to migrate downstream. Essentially the same pattern as this can be seen at somewhat higher altitudes in the North York Moors, where certain of the drainage hollows on the plateau, notably at Fen Bog, have zonations which, though also affected by burning and grazing, still show the controlling influence of a stagnation gradient. In this area, though, and around the upland fringes of the southern Pennines, the Calluna-Deschampsia heath is more often found in what is really a reverse sequence of communities, giving way over gentler slopes at higher altitudes to wet heath, then to blanket mire, with the development of increasingly thick ombrogenous peats. In the North York Moors, the Calluna-Deschampsia heath and the Juncus-Dicranum sub-community of the Ericetum tetralicis form the bulk of the vegetation cover over the complex patchworks of Anglezarke humo-ferric pod zols, Maw stagnopodzols and Wilcocks stagnohumic gleys, with relatively small areas of Calluna-Er iophorum mire marking out Winter Hill peats, almost the whole of these patterns being overlain by systems of swiddens burned for grouse-rearing. On the Pennines, the wet heath zone is much less extensive and the Calluna-Deschampsia heath frequently gives way directly, over what is often a much fretted fringe to the ombrogenous peat, to the blanket mire vegetation, characteristically in this part of Britain of the Eriophorum type, in which the effects of pollution, grazing, burning and draining are also all too evident. In such zonations, the increase in the abundance of Eriophorum vaginatum among the heather is often the only indicator of the switch in vegetation types, species such as Deschampsiaflexuosa, the acrocar pous mosses and encrusting lichens maintaining their frequency over the dry peat margins. Patches of the Calluna-Deschampsia heath can recur at higher levels where the peat blanket is interrupted by grit outcrops but, increasingly in the wetter cooler climate of these high edges, the community is replaced by the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath in which bilberry is the typical dominant. Rather different kinds of vegetation patterns are to be seen where the Calluna-Deschampsia heath occurs on tracts of prevailingly dry, base-poor and oligotrophic soils, such as have developed on sandstone scarps and plateaus and over coarser superficials at lower altitudes through the range of the community. In such situations, it is patchworks of the heath with grasslands and woodlands that make up the bulk of the scenery, so characteristic of places like Delamere and Sherwood Forests and the higher ground in Cannock Chase. Such patterns are largely a reflection of treatment history, with burning and grazing, or their neglect, playing a major part in the disposition of stands of various of the sub-communities of the Calluna-Deschampsia heath, of Deschampsia flexuosa grassland, which is often a grazed derivative of the Galium sub-community within which heather has been substantially reduced, and of the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland, which is the characteristic climax forest of dry, acidic soils in this part of Britain, derived from the heath by invasion of oak and birch. Widespread abandonment of traditional treatments has often favoured the succession to woodland, with the virtual extinction of heath in some sites, though temporary patches of the Calluna-Deschampsia community comprise the typical gap flora of the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland. In many places, too, land-use changes have led to an extensive spread of the Pteridium-Galium community which can readily replace the Calluna-Deschampsia heath on the deeper of the soils that it favours. Commercial afforestation has also been extensive over many stretches of podzolised soils through the range of the Calluna-Deschampsia heath which, with some preparation, can support reasonable crops of Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra var. maritima and larches, all of which, especially the pines, are readily able to seed into remaining tracts of open heathland around. The brown sand soils of the Midland plain too, though droughty, highly impoverished and susceptible to erosion by wind and rain, are readily worked and many areas have been reclaimed and improved for arable and pastoral agriculture, fragmenting the remaining distribution of the community. Distribution "
"m1","Zonation and succession On more featureless mires, the Sphagnum auriculatum community can contribute to ill-defined areas of wetter vegetation (e.g. Newbould 1960, Goode & Lindsay 1979, Boatman et al. 1981), but it is best developed as the pool and wet hollow component in certain patterned Erico-Sphagnion mires where it grades, with increasing height above the water-table, to flat and hummock vegetation. There is only limited evidence that such mosaics represent a full regenerative sequence of alternating pools and hummocks. Throughout western Britain, the community is found most consistently within the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire, on domed or slightly sloping areas within blanket mire or in areas which bear a more obvious resemblance to raised mire. Where surface patterning is pronounced, it passes, round the margins of pools and wetter hollows to the Drosera-Sphagnum sub-community of the mire proper, with a switch in the Sphagnum carpet from S. auriculatum and S. cuspidatum to S. papillosum, S. subnitens and S. tenellum (and, locally, S. magellanicum) and thence to S. capillifolium. Drosera rotundifolia and, more locally, D. anglica run some way into this transitional vegetation, Narthecium and Eriophorum angustifolium much further; and there is a substantial increase in Molinia and Erica tetralix and an appearance of Eriophorum vaginatum and Scirpus cespitosus. Mixtures of these species continue on as vascular dominants of the Cladonia sub-community of the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire which typically makes up the vegetation cover of the hummock sides and tops in such systems. The vertical stratification of the major species in relation to water-table is well seen in profiles from the Silver Flowe mosses (Ratcliffe & Walker 1958) and Kentra Moss (British Ecological Society Mires Group unpub.). On degraded blanket mires in western Britain, fragmentary Sphagnum auriculatum pools may persist in the Juncus-Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire. On moving further east in Scotland, where the Erica-Sphagnum mire replaces the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire on lowland raised bogs, the Sphagnum auriculatum bog pool is replaced by the Sphagnum cuspidatum!recurvum type, and intermediate stands may be encountered in the transitional zone. In southern lowland valley bogs, the Sphagnum auri culatum community occupies an analogous position in patterned Narthecio-Sphagnetum mire, though here hummock-hollow systems tend to be less well defined and there is the complication of soligenous influence along the axes and around the margins of the bogs. Also, Sphagnum capillifolium and Eriophorum angustifolium play a less prominent role in the drier elements of the vegetation than to the north-west. But, these things apart, the general pattern is the same: typically, the community gives way to the Sphagnum-Rhynchospora sub-community of Narthecio-Sphagnetum mire, S. papillosum, S. tenellum and S. subnitens increasing their cover and Molinia, Erica tetralix and Calluna becoming important. Such transitions are well described in the various phases of Rose's (1953) Sphagnum Hummock Complex and were included in the 'general bog communities' characterised by Newbould (1960) from Cranesmoor in the New Forest. It has sometimes been assumed that such zonations as these are a spatial expression of a cyclic alternation of hollows and hummocks in regenerative bog growth (e.g. Tansley 1939) but, as noted above, thé evidence for this is limited. The Sphagnum auriculatum community may thus often be a fairly permanent self-maintaining feature of mire surfaces with rather limited switches from more to less aquatic Sphagna but no guaranteed progression to the vegetation of drier flats and hummocks. Where mire drainage lowers the water-table, the community is readily damaged or destroyed and it has been widely lost where Erico-Sphagnion communities have been converted to Ericion heaths or their degraded derivatives. Shallow peat-digging can create flooded hollows which become suitable for recolonisation by Sphagna, Rhynchospora alba and Drosera ssp. but such locally reconstituted stands often lie in much modified mire contexts (Rose 1953).Distribution "
"m10","Zonation and succession The Pinguiculo-Caricetum marks out areas of soligenous influence of base-rich and calcareous waters, often in association with spring and rill vegetation, within grasslands and more occasionally in ombrogenous mires and around topogenous mires. Stands are usually small and their definition in zonations depends on the strength of flushing and the degree of base-enrichment. Most stands Figure 14.

The most widespread situation in which the community occurs is within sub-montane pastures where it typically forms a zone below springs and flush-lines, often pear-shaped and elongated downslope below iso lated sites of irrigation, in larger stands of more complex configuration where flushing is extensive. Towards the source of flushing it commonly gives way to Cratoneur-ion spring vegetation, usually the Cratoneuron-Festuca rubra community which can extend as a narrow strip down a central vigorous rill. In Scotland especially but also in the Lake District and more locally in the Pen-nines, Saxifraga aizoides rises to prominence in the continuously splashed zone to the centre of these flushes and there is frequently a clear intervening band of the Carici-Saxifragetum (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Birks 1973). Where the waters are somewhat less base-rich, the spring vegetation may be represented by the Crato-neuron-Carex nigra community, particularly towards higher altitudes in Scotland, where this vegetation type subsumes part of McVean & Ratcliffe's (1962) Hypno-Caricetum alpinum, or even by some kind of Philonotis flush where the waters are only weakly calcareous (Holdgate 1955a, Pigott 1956a). Where flushing occurs on more level ground, complex mosaics of these communities can be seen around the springs (e.g. Poore 1955a, McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). Towards the margins of these flushes, the Pinguiculo-Caricetum gives way, with varying degrees of abruptness, to the pasture vegetation on drier ground, often standing out in the smooth swards, by virtue of its uneven and broken surface. In Scotland, where the community is generally represented by the Carex-Juncus sub-community, a very widespread context for the Pinguiculo-Caricetum is the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, the common plagioclimax sward of more base-rich brown earths associated with local calcareous outcrops in the Dalradian and, less so, the Moine Assemblages and the Durness Limestone of the far north-west (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Birks 1973, Rat cliffe 1977). In the Lake District, a similar zonation can be seen on more calcareous parts of the Borrowdale Volcanics. In Scotland, too, in situations where the surrounding soils are somewhat less base-rich, the Pinguiculo-Caricetum can occur within stretches of the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath. In both of these grassland types, a Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea sub-community often forms a transition zone on the mildly-irrigated surrounds to the flush (Figure 14) but more abrupt zonations can occur and where soligenous base-enrichment is very localised within stretches of more prevailingly pervious and acidic rocks and soils, the Pinguiculo-Caricetum may be very sharply marked off* from calcifugous Festuca-Agrostis grassland. Comparable zonations to the above can be found in the northern Pennines, though here the Briza-Primula sub-community is the usual kind of Pinguiculo-Caricetum and the pasture is generally the Sesleria-Galium grassland. With the more uniformly calcareous con dition of the soils over the Carboniferous Limestones, there is often a very strong floristic continuity between the different vegetation types, the axis of variation being largely controlled by the amount of soil moisture. A common sequence is from the Typical sub-community of the grassland, through (again) a Carex pulicaris-Carex panicea sub-community and then to the Molinia-Eriophorum variant of the mire, species such as Sesleria, Festuca ovina, Carex flacca, Briza media and Linum catharticum running throughout with virtually undiminished frequency. In Upper Teesdale, the presence of species such as Kobresia, Carex capillaris, Plantago maritima and Racomitrium uliginosum enriches both the pasture (often represented by its Carex-Kobresia sub community) and the drier parts of the mire (in the Thymus-Racomitrium variant) in this kind of zonation and the Gymnostomum sub-community appears on the open gravels (Pigott 1956a, Ratcliffe 1965, Jones 1973, Bradshaw & Jones 1976). Sadly, some of the most intricate of these patterns were lost beneath the Cow Green reservoir. More locally in northern England and north Wales, the Briza-Primula sub-community can pick out flushes within the Festuca-Avenula grassland or, in Durham, the Sesleria-Scabio sa grassland. Less common than these kinds of situation, though often very striking because of the close juxtaposition of rather different vegetation types, are those occurrences of the Pinguiculo-Caricetum around places of soligenous base-enrichment within ombrogenous mires. Fragments of perched blanket mire can sometimes be found where springs are biting back on to gentle peat-clad slopes above (as in upper Teesdale: Pigott 1956a) but, in Scotland, the Carex-Juncus sub-community can occur in prevailing ombrogenous systems, particularly at lower altitudes in the west, where it gives way directly to the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire or sometimes to an intervening zone of the Carex panicea sub-community of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath, into which C. panicea, C. pulicaris, C. echinata, C. demissa, Pinguicula vulgaris, Selaginella selaginoides and locally dominant Schoenus nigricans extend their cover (Poore 1955a, McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). In this kind of setting, and where the Pinguiculo-Caricetum occurs more locally in stretches of heath on thin, dry peats, the community typically stands out as fresh green patches. Although the flushes with which this kind of mire is associated are often isolated (though repeated) on slopes, they sometimes feed topogenous fens in basins or channels and then the Pinguiculo-Caricetum can form a fringing zone around the central area, passing to communities like the Carex-Calliergon mire or, more exclusively at higher altitudes, the Carex-Sphagnum warnstorfii mire on the deeper peat of the more stagnant waters. Such transitions are well seen in small hollows in the central Highlands (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962), where the Carex-Juncus sub-community forms the margins, and at Sunbiggin Tarn (Holdgate 1955a) and Malham Tarn (Sinker 1960, Proctor 1974), where the Briza-Primula sub-community occurs. Almost throughout its range, the Pinguiculo-Caricetum is strongly affected by grazing animals. Without such influence, many stands would probably be open to invasion by shrubs and trees though nutrient deficiency in the soils might be an important hindrance to some species. Likely colonisers are Betula pubescens, Salix cinerea and, in these northern localities, S. pentandr a, S. phylicifolia, S. nigricans and Prunus padus with Fraxinus excelsior figuring on drier margins; Alnus glutinosa is more problematic because of the difficulty of fruit transport. Such mixtures are most characteristic of our Alno-Ulmion woodlands like the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland and wetter stands of the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland, beneath the canopies of which there is often a good representation of the kinds of tall herbs that figure in the Cirsium palustre variant here. In some localities, as in Teesdale and Weardale in Durham and in Swaledale in North Yorkshire, small patches of Pinguiculo-Caricetum persist in the wetter parts of traditionally-treated hay-meadows, whose vegetation has probably been secondarily derived from these kinds of forest (Pigott 1956a). Distribution "
"m11","Zonation and succession The Carici-Saxifragetum is found around springs and flushes, often in association with other calcicolous soli-genous mire vegetation, among sub-montane and high-altitude grasslands and dwarf herb communities and, more occasionally, within ombrogenous bogs. Typically, the stands are small and the definition of the vegetation sequences depends on the strength of irrigation and the amount of base-enrichment of the flush and its surrounds. Grazing may help maintain the open structure of the community and prevent the development of a woody cover, though colonisation by shrubs and trees on the wet and cold soils characteristic here would probably be slow and, at higher altitudes, this kind of mire is probably a climatic climax. Where the Carici-Saxifragetum marks out flushes within stretches of upland pasture, the general pattern of vegetation is the same throughout its range, running, in its fullest development, from Cratoneurion communities around spring-heads, flush-lines and their asso ciated rills, through the Carici-Saxifragetum, then through small-sedge soligenous mire on the less strongly-irrigated surrounds, to the swards of the drier soils beyond. Where vigorous flushes emerge locally on steeper slopes, this kind of pattern can be very well defined, with concentric zones of the different communities elongated downhill; where irrigation is more diffuse and more extensively spread, the zonation may be much less clear, often expressed as a complex mosaic, with the elements associated with stronger water-flow less well developed. At low altitudes, generally below 500 m, where the Carici-Saxifragetum is typically represented by the Cratoneuron-Eleocharis sub-community, it is often sur rounded by the Pinguiculo-Caricetum, usually some variant of the Carex-Juncus sub-community or, in the north Pennines where the Carici-Saxifragetum occurs very locally, some variant of the Briza-Primula sub community. In such situations, the two kinds of mire can come very close floristically, particularly in those localities beyond the southern limit of Saxifraga aizoides, and the transition between the two is consequently very diffuse. Locally, too, an abundance throughout of Schoenus nigricans (or, in a few localities in Perthshire, S.ferrugineus'. Wheeler et al. 1983) can give an overlying impression of structural uniformity.Beyond this zone of more strongly-flushed, often unstable and sometimes heavily stock-poached soils, there is commonly a gradation to some type of calcicolous grassland, with a closing up of the turf, over drier profiles. Most often, this is the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland: Saxifraga aizoides and some other hydrophilous herbs can run some way into this pasture in its Saxifraga-Ditrichum sub-community (the Saxifrageto-Agrosto-Festucetum of McVean & Ratcliffe 1962) which can form a transitional zone to the unflushed sward. At somewhat higher altitudes, and perhaps on somewhat less base-rich soils, the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath can provide the context, with its Carex pulicaris-C. panicea sub-community immediately around the flushed areas. In the east-central Highlands, Betula pubescens and Juniperus communis ssp. communis are ready invaders of the less strongly-waterlogged soils of such sequences and the Carici-Saxifragetum forms an important part of the ground mosaic beneath open stands of birch and juniper at sites like Morrone (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Ratcliffe 1977, Huntley & Birks 1979a). At higher altitudes throughout its range, the Carici-Saxifragetum is represented in such zonations by the Thalictrum-Juncus sub-community and, particularly in Breadalbane and more locally to the north-west of Scotland, there is a shift in all the components of the sequence to present a more strikingly montane character. Thus, the Pinguiculo-Caricetum in the surrounding zone is replaced by the Caricetum saxatilis and it is open stony areas in both this community and the Carici-Saxifragetum which provide the major locus for such Arctic-Alpine rarities as Carex atrofusca, C. microglo-chin, Juncus biglumis and J. castaneus and many of the Scottish stations for Kobresia. Then, at these high levels, the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene dwarf-herb community often forms the surround to the springs on soils which are not so strongly flushed by the springs, though which are kept continually moist by high rainfall and snowmelt and maintained in a similar unstable state by solifluction and cryoturbation. Complexes of these vegetation types, forming a short, diverse and open cover over sparkling mica-schist soils, make a major contribution to the glory of sites like Ben Lawers (e.g. Poore 19556, Raven & Walters 1956, McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). The Cratoneurion communities represented in such sequences are typically low swards like the Cratoneuron-Festuca vegetation, in which S. aizoides often continues to be very prominent, or the less calcicolous Cratoneuron-Carex nigra community. However, where flush waters trickle down very steep rocky faces with ledges, the Saxifraga-Alchemilla tail-herb community can occur in close juxtaposition with the Carici-Saxifragetum. The two vegetation types are floristically quite similar and the Polygonum variant of the latter community, which Huntley (1979) described from the Clova-Caenlochan area, is floristically intermediate. Salix reticulata finds an occasional place in this kind of Carici-Saxifragetum and it is possible that these vegetation types represent a grazing-mediated succession on more inaccessible dripping crags that would culminate in the development of the Salix-Luzula Arctic-Alpine willow scrub. Even under favourable environmental conditions, however, this sere is, at most, only locally active because of the now very wide dispersal of potential parent bushes. In zonations of the above types, the continuity of floristic variation, with a gradual lessening of the influence of irrigation and base-enrichment in moving away from the springs, is often very obvious. Where the Carici-Saxifragetum marks out flushed sites within ombrogenous mires and related wet-heaths, the soligenous areas are usually much more sharply delineated from their surrounds. The context of flushing can be the Calluna-Eriophorum blanket mire or, at lower altitudes towards the west, the Scirpus-Eriophorum blanket mire or degraded forms of this bog placed in the Scirpus-Erica wet-heath. The Carici-Saxifragetum can again be surrounded by a zone of the Caricetum saxatilis or, at lower levels, the Pinguiculo-Caricetum, but there is typically a very sharp switch from these mires on sloppy mineral soil in the soligenous tracks to the ombrogenous vegetation on the peat around, often with a low, steep bank between. Poore (19556) and McVean & Ratcliffe (1962) both illustrated some very distinctive mosaics of this kind, with isolated hummocks of ombrogenous mire occurring detached from the surrounding bog within the soligenous zone. The latter authors noted how the flushes could isolate such fragments from the effects of burning of the main bog surface, sheltering a refuge for such species as Sphagnum imbricatum and Dicranum bergeri.Distribution "
"m12","Zonation and succession The Caricetum saxatilis typically occurs as small stands bordering rills or more strongly-irrrigated soligenous mires. It is possible that grazing prevents colonisation by Arctic-Alpine willows, though in the extreme environment characteristic here, the community is probably a climatic climax. Towards the lower end of its altitudinal range, the Caricetum saxatilis overlaps considerably with the Car ici-Saxifragetum and it can often be found as a fringing zone to this mire, giving way around to the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene dwarf-herb community or, at its low est stations, to the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla or Fes tuca-Agrostis-Thymus grasslands. Dryas-Silene vege tation can also figure among these zonations on rocky banks and, on dripping crags close to the source of irrigation, the Saxifraga-Alchemilla community. Such sequences are very characteristic of the Breadalbane area and more isolated localities in the north-west Highlands. At the very highest altitudes, the Carici-Saxifragetum may be absent from the flushes, when the Caricetum saxatilis gives way directly to the spring or rill vege tation, usually some kind of Cratoneuron-Festuca or Cratoneuron-Carex nigra flush. It can also occur in close association with some of the more calcicolous snow-bed communities. As with the other kinds of calcicolous flushes, the Caricetum saxatilis can sometimes be found within a markedly less calcicolous context, marking out very local areas of base-enrichment. Then, it can occur with the Carex-Sphagnum russowii mire, in water-tracks more remote from the source of flushing, and give way laterally to montane Nardo-Galion grasslands with Nardus stricta, Juncus squarrosus and Deschampsia cespitosa. Distribution "
"m13","Zonation and succession The Schoenetum occurs in zonations around springs and seepage lines where natural variation in the vegetation is related primarily to the height of the water-table in sequences of mineral and organic soils, the character and disposition of which are determined by geology and the pattern of flushing. But such zonations have been widely affected by a variety of treatments such as grazing, mowing and peat-cutting, so that some of their components are plagioclimax vegetation, now often further altered by successional changes attendant upon neglect. Other changes have been induced by drainage and eutrophication and widespread improvement of surrounding land has also left many stands isolated and much modified within intensive agricultural landscapes. In more intact zonations developed over entirely calcareous substrates, the Schoenetum typically grades, on the gleyed mineral soils above seepage lines or around more localised springs, to richer kinds of Junco-Molinion vegetation like the Cirsio-Molinie tum, in which both Schoenus and J. subnodulosus can persist but where dominance generally passes to Molinia. This, in turn, may grade to some kind of Mesobromion grass land on the dry, lithomorphic calcareous soils beyond: usually, within the range of the Schoenetum, this is the Festuca-Avenula grassland. Where flushing occurs more abruptly over limestone slopes, the Schoenetum can give way directly to such a calcicolous sward (Figure 15). In the other direction, where the Schoenetum occurs above and sometimes extends on to deeper peats which have accumulated in valleys and basins under the close influence of calcareous and oligotrophic ground waters, the community can pass directly to some kind of Phrag-mitetalia vegetation, often the Cladietum marisci, on the waterlogged organic soils. Sometimes, in such sequences, the Schoenetum can itself be zoned, the Festuca-Juncus sub-community occupying the drier ground, the Briza-Pinguicula the moister soils and the Caltha-Galium the wettest, and the last type can also be found in hollows on peat with the Carex-Calliergon mire among a matrix of the Cladietum. Such patterns as these are especially characteristic of the Anglesey mires such as Cors Bodeilio, Cors y Farl, Cors Goch and, to a lesser extent, Cors Erddreiniog (Wheeler 1975, Ratcliffe & Hattey 1982 Site group IX). In less consistently oligotrophic situations, the Schoenetum occurs in generally similar zonations, but in association with other communities. Where it occurs around valley mires, for example, in which the peats experience some deposition of allochthonous mineral material, it can give way below to the Phragmitetum australis swamp or some kind of Phragmitetalia tail herb fen, generally the Phragmites-Eupatorium com munity. This is well seen in some of the East Anglian fens like Smallburgh, Seaming, Redgrave/South Lopham and Thelnetham/Blo' Norton (Bellamy & Rose 1961, Haslam 1965, Wheeler 1975,1978, Ratcliffe 1977). And, where the gleyed soils around the flushes are somewhat richer than those typically supporting the Cirsio-Moli-nietum, the Schoenetum can grade above to the Juncus-Cirsium community or the Holco-Juncetum and thence, on the drier mineral profiles, to some kind of Cynosur-ion sward. Where irrigation with calcareous waters is a very local phenomenon within tracts of acidic substrates and soils, the community can be found among more calcifugous vegetation. On some of the Norfolk heaths, like Buxton Heath for example, where calcareous drift occupies the bottoms of some hollows and valleys the Schoenetum passes, above the seepage lines, to the Ericetum tetralicis on base-poor gleys. Other Schoenus vegetation in these 'mixed mires' is, however, perhaps better placed in the Schoenus-Narthecium community. Traditional treatments have variously influenced zonations such as these. The middle and drier parts of the sequences were often subject to grazing by stock, the middle and wetter parts to mowing for hay, litter or marsh crops like sedge and reed. Such treatments had the general effect of holding back succession to woodhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press134 Mires land throughout, but they have probably also influenced the balance of the different components, increasing the extent of one community against another according to the particular regimes of grazing and mowing adopted, treatments which affect the vegetation directly but also modify the nutrient budget of the system. As far as the Schoenetum itself is concerned, the former effects have probably modified transitions to tail-herb fens and swamps by influencing the amounts of Phragmites and Cladium in the vegetation (e.g. Godwin 1941, Haslam 1965), and altered the balance within the community between the Schoenus, J. subnodulosus and Molinia. And alterations in nutrient budget perhaps play a part in the Figure 15. Schoenus communities among fen (a) and bog (b) sequences. Ml3b Schoenetum mire, Briza-Pinguicula sub-community Ml3c Schoenetum mire, Caltha-Galium sub-community M14 Schoenus-Narthecium mire Ml6a Ericetum tetralicis wet heath, Typical sub-community Ml6b Ericetum tetralicis wet heath, Succisa-Carex sub-community balance between the Schoenetum and the Cirsio-Moli-nietum and Juncus-Cirsium community (Wheeler 1983). Treatment regimes have been very variable so actual zonations can be similarly diverse, added to which we now often see their influence blurred by the effects of long neglect, particularly over the surface of peats where mowing for marsh crops has fallen into virtually total disuse. A common pattern now is for the Schoenetum to form the wettest component in a fairly open herbaceous sequence, still maintained by grazing, and to give way below to very dense sedge-or reed-beds or to woodland that has colonised tail-herb fen and swamp. Such transitions have become more frequent with the M21 Narthecio-Sphagnetum valley bog M24a Cirsio-Molinietum fen-meadow, Eupatorium sub-community M24b Cirsio-Molinietum fen-meadow, Typical sub-community M24c Cirsio-Molinietum fen-meadow, Juncus-Erica sub-community CG2 Festuca-Avenula grassland S2 Cladietum swamp S25 Phragmites-Eupatorium fen H4 Ulex minor-Agrostis heath https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.017 Published online by Cambridge University PressM13 Schoenetum nigricantis mire 135 extensive drainage of impeded soils in the British low lands, either locally or as a result of major works which have lowered the water-table in whole catchments (as on the Little Ouse where the Thelnetham and Bio' Norton fens have been affected: Ratcliffe 1977). Such treatment tends to speed colonisation of any unreclaimed mire fragments by woody vegetation and has probably des troyed many stands of Schoenetum itself. Even where the community persists, it is often in the form of the impoverished Festuca-Juncus sub-community or transitions to rank Junco-Molinion vegetation. On its other boundary, where it grades on to drier soils, the community has suffered by assiduous agricultural improvement right up to spring and flush lines such that natural zonations are often truncated above, any remaining Schoenetum closely hemmed in by arable land or modified pasture. Eutrophication by fertiliser run-off or drift is a common danger to the community in such situations and, with enrichment of peats by drainage and surface oxidation, the vegetation is open to conversion to Fili-pendulion tail-herb communities, with the Phragmites-Urtica fen on any fragments of wetter soils. With such complex modifications of the habitat of the Schoenetum, it is difficult to tell what the natural serai development of the community might be. Scattered saplings of Ainus glutinosa, Betula pubescens and Salix cinerea can sometimes be found in ungrazed stands (Wheeler 1975) and it is possible that mixed canopies of such species could come to dominate in some kind of Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland over topogenous peats (Wheeler 1980c). Local development of ombrotro-phic nuclei in such situations, or the formation of raised areas within soligenous mires, probably favours a spread of Molinia and preferential invasion by B. pubescens with the eventual formation of some type of Betula-Molinia woodland. Schoenus itself, of course, may play an important role in providing initial sites for the development of acidophilous elements in the flora but, although it can persist for a considerable time under shading branches, it quickly succumbs to the formation of a closed canopy. Distribution "
"m14","Zonation and succession The Schoenus-Narthecium mire is typically found in zonations and mosaics with valley bog and heath com munities whose distribution reflects edaphic and hydro-logical variation. Some stands would probably progress to woodland in the absence of burning or grazing. Where the community occurs in valley mires, it typi cally occupies the zones of moderate soligenous enrichment with bases and calcium, passing laterally to the Narthecio-Sphagnetum on more impoverished and acid peats with a more stagnant water-table, the transition being marked by the disappearance of Schoenus and the extension of the carpet of peat-building Sphagna. Molinia and E. tetralix continue to be well represented on the more raised areas and Rhynchospora alba becomes common, particularly around wetter hollows, where Sphagnum auriculatum pools can be found. Base-poor soligenous tracts in such sequences can have Littorelle-tea vegetation like the Hyperico-Potametum. Characteristically, the Narthecio-Sphagnetum gives way around valley mires to the Ericetum tetralicis and, in some places, this community can be found in direct contact with the Schoenus-Narthecium mire, grading to it through the Succisa-Carex sub-community. Such vegetation may also form a surround to the community where it occurs as slope flushes within tracts of heath, but often it grades in such situations to some kind of Junco-Molinion grassland, in which Molinia is an over whelming dominant and where Schoenus can be sporadically represented, a pattern well seen on the Ayles-beare Common heaths in Devon, described by Ivimey-Cook et al. (X975). Throughout such sequences as these, variations in base-richness and the amount of calcium are probably often quite small (Newbould 1960). In contrast to related vegetation on north-western blanket bogs, the Schoenus-Narthecium mire is probably not a climax community. Succession has never been followed but might be expected to involve invasion by Salix cinerea, Betula pubescens and perhaps Alnus gluti-nosa and the eventual development of some sort of wet woodland. Distribution "
"m15","Zonation and succession Zonations within stands of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath and between the community and other vegetation types generally reflect variations in the soil moisture regime, sometimes with attendant differences in base-and nutrient-status. Such patterns are often overlain by the effects of treatments and, in some cases, the community may represent a serai intermediate between blanket mire and either dry heath or grassland. Without burning or grazing, less-damaged stands might be able to revert to blanket mire or progress to woodland. Much vegetation of this kind has been replaced by coniferous forest after draining of the ground. The intermediate character of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath frequently finds spatial expression in its occurrence as a zone between Sphagnetalia bogs and Calluno-Ulicetalia heaths, the particular nature of the vegetation types and their proportions in the zonations varying with geographical locality, altitude and the character of the terrain. Most often, at lower altitudes in western Britain, where the community is best developed, it occurs in close association with the Scirpus-Eriophorum blanket mire, grading to it in hollows and over gently-undulating ground where there is accumulation of deeper peat with a high and stagnant water-table. More Sphagnum-rich stands of the Typical sub-community may form a more or less gradual transition to the blanket mire, being replaced, on more free-draining slopes, first by less Sphagnum-rich stands of this sub community, then by the Cladonia sub-community over thinner, drier peats. This, in turn, can give way to dry heath on sharply-draining podzols, generally some form of Calluna-Erica cinerea or Calluna-Vaccinium heath, though often dominated overwhelmingly by Calluna, a physiognomic feature which can extend a considerable way into the wet heath, where there has been more controlled burning, and which can therefore blur the upper part of the vegetation sequence. In areas with lower rainfall, the whole zonation tends to move downslope, the Sphagnum-rich Typical sub community, rather than the Scirpus-Eriophorum blanket mire, occupying the wettest ground in hollows and the Cladonia sub-community extending less far up the surrounding slopes before being replaced by drier heath. A similar effect on the upper part of the zonation can be seen where the communities occur over south-facing slopes where the drier heath component can be especially extensive; on northerly aspects, on the other hand, the Scirpus-Erica wet heath transgresses far on to steeper ground (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). Increased water movement through the peats is often marked by a rise in the proportion of Molinia through stands of the Typical sub-community and, where soligenous influence is most pronounced, with enhanced aeration and sometimes an increase in base-status and perhaps nutrient content, stretches of the Carex sub community may clothe gentler slopes or occur within definite soakways, running through both the Scirpus-Erica wet heath and the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire and quite often along streams that drain from the peat through surrounding heaths and grasslands. Very fre quently, such zones of water movement are marked most obviously by the presence of Myrica, a feature readily discerned from a distance on the ground or from aerial photographs. Where the Scirpus-Erica wet heath extends to higher altitudes, as it does in Scotland and more locally in northern England and Wales, it can also be found in association with the Calluna-Eriophorum blanket mire, typically forming a zone below it where the peat thins out on steeper or convex slopes. In the north-west Highlands, the community often forms an altitudinal band separating the two kinds of blanket mire and grading in each direction to them. Further east in Scotland, where the Scirpus-Eriophorum bog becomes increasingly rare, the Scirpus-Erica wet heath can occur below the Calluna-Eriophorum mire in transitions to drier heath or grassland (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Birks 1973, Birse 1980). Generally, however, in this part of Britain, the community is replaced in such sequences by the Ericetum tetralicis. Fragments of these kinds of zonations are of widespread occurrence where the climate or the terrain is unsuitable for the development of the full sequence and each of the sub-communities can be found alone in vegetation patterns. The Typical and Cladonia sub https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.019 Published online by Cambridge University Press150 Mires communities, for example, often mark out the most ill-drained patches of ground in gently-undulating land scapes clothed with grasslands and heaths over podzols with varying degrees of drainage impedence and shallow peat accumulation. And the Carex sub-community is of widespread occurrence along fairly base-poor soakways in tracts of heaths and grasslands, well away from stands of other kinds of Scirpus-Erica wet heath or blanket mire (Edgell 1969). In such situations, it may pass, along the water-tracks, to different types of soligenous mire according to the degree of base-and nutrient-enrichment of the incoming waters. Even where extensive zonations occur, however, they have been very widely affected by treatments. Less severe burning and/or grazing can impose a uniformity of dominance over much of the sequence, masking the transition from one vegetation type to another. More drastic or long-continued treatments, particularly where these accentuate the effects of natural degeneration of peatlands, have a more profound influence on the floristics. It is likely that some stands of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath have been derived from blanket mire as a result of a combination of climatic change, burning and grazing. Sphagnetalia communities affected by these factors tend to lose their luxuriant carpet of Sphagna and to show an increase in either Racomitrium lanuginosum and lichens or Nardetalia herbs and hyp-noid mosses (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962), trends which can be seen, for example, in the Cladonia and Juncus-Rhytidiadelphus sub-communities of the Scirpus-Erio-phorum blanket mire. Elimination of Eriophorum vagi-natum from these vegetation types can produce assemblages which are indistinguishable from the Cladonia and Vaccinium sub-communities of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath and extensive mosaics of these vegetation types can be seen on many areas of degenerating ombro-genous peat. Deep sheet-erosion may lead to a replacement of the Carex sub-community in such patterns by the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire in widespread systems of runnels (Birks 1973), and where the wasting peat is washed down over the slopes below, there can be transitions to Nardetalia grasslands with much N ar dus and Juncus squarrosus. Although in the far west, blanket mire seems to be able to regenerate in less-disturbed areas of wet ground (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962), it seems unlikely that pro gression to the Scirpus-Erica wet heath or beyond can be readily reversed. Cessation of burning, especially on peat that is naturally well-aerated or where there has been draining, may precipitate a vigorous expansion of Molinia and, in some areas, blanket mires and wet heath seem to have converged into vast tracts of Molinia-dominated grasslands in which Sphagnetalia or Sphagno-Ericetalia species play a relatively minor role, mosaics among them being shaded out or at least masked by the dominant. Invasion of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath by woody species is probably theoretically possible over most, if not all, its altitudinal range but widespread deforestation has often removed potential seed-parents, and continued grazing by stock and deer and sporadic burning may be enough to set back succession continually. Betula pubescens and Pinus sylvestris are the most likely invaders of the characteristic soils here, especially on the drier ground of the Cladonia and Vaccinium sub-communities, but seedlings are rarely found. Coniferous plantations, on the other hand, have been established over extensive stretches of drained ombrogenous peat, some of which probably carried the Scirpus-Erica wet heath. Distribution "
"m16","Zonation and succession The Ericetum tetralicis occurs as part of zonations related to the height of the water-table in sequences of acid and oligotrophic soils. Locally, these can be complicated by increased soligenous influence on slopes or by variations in the base-richness and trophic state of soil parent materials or waters. Burning can superimpose differences in floristics and structure and frequent firing and/or draining degrades the community. In the absence of grazing and burning, the Ericetum progresses to woodland. When fully developed around lowland valley mires, the pattern of communities in which the Ericetum occurs is very striking (e.g. Rose 1953, Wheeler 1983). Downslope, on the deep, wet peats of the bog itself, it gives way to the Narthecio-Sphagnetum with the Sphagnum auriculatum bog-pool community in deeper hollows, many of the species of the Ericetum running on into the lawn and hummock component of the mire surface, but Sphagnum compactum and, to a lesser extent, S. tenellum, being replaced by S. papillosum and S. magellanicum. Beyond this, towards the main axis of the mire, there is often a zone of Littorelletea vegetation or Caricion nigrae poor fen and then a central strip of Salix-Galium woodland. https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.020 Published online by Cambridge University Press164 Mires In mires with a little more enrichment, the last community may be replaced by the Alnus-Carex woodland from which patchy Caricetumpaniculatae swamp may run out a little way. Upslope from the Ericetum, with the passage to drier acidic soils, there is a transition to Calluno-Ulicetalia heath, though the particular community involved varies according to the region in which the site occurs. In the more continental climate of East Anglia, a sharp switch to the Calluna-Festuca dry heath is characteristic but, with the shift into the more oceanic southwest, so-called 'humid heaths' are interposed in the sequence, first the Ulex minor-Agrostis curtisii heath in sites around the Hampshire basin, and then from there westwards the Ulex gallii-Agrostis heath. Increasingly, in such zonations, both E. tetralix and Molinia, as well as Calluna, maintain their representation through these intermediate vegetation types, so it is generally the downslope limit of E. cinerea, the Ulex spp. and A. curtisii that marks the transition to the Ericion wet heath. Above these zonations, pockets of deeper, well-drained soil can have stands of the Pteridium-Galium community or, where there has been some enrichment of the ground, the Rubus-Pteridium underscrub or Ulex-Rubus scrub, the latter especially characteristic of dis turbed places, as along trackways. Complete zonations of this kind can still be seen in and around the series of New Forest valley mires, such as the Denny/Shatterford system and Wilverley, Holms-ley and Matley bogs (Rose 1953, Tubbs 1968, Ratcliffe 1977, NCC New Forest Bogs Report 1984) and on some of the south Dorset heaths, like Morden, though there the Ericetum is reduced to a narrow zone around a rather flat-bottomed valley (Ratcliffe 1977). Elsewhere, the sequence of communities is incomplete below. At Thursley Common in Surrey, for example, the Narthe-cio-Sphagnetum terminates the zonation below (Rose 1953, Ratcliffe 1977) and, quite often, it is the Ericetum itself which occupies the wettest ground, clothing the bottom of shallow valleys and hollows. This is the case on some of the remaining Sussex commons like Ash down Forest, over the northern New Forest terraces (Fisher 1975«, b) and on many of the fragments of south Dorset heathland, where there are the additional features of the presence of Erica ciliaris in a number of the communities and the close juxtaposition with openwater and maritime vegetation (Chapman 1975, Rat cliffe 1977). In other sites, the basic sequence of communities is complicated by the interpolation of other vegetation types related to base-or nutrient-richness in the sub strates or waters. In some of the New Forest mires, like Cranesmoor for example (Newbould 1960), on Hartland Moor in Dorset (Ratcliffe 1977) and at Aylesbeare Common in Devon (Ivimey-Cook et al. 1975), the Schoenus-Narthecium community figures prominently along the axes of soligenous water movement and, in the last site, there are also extensive stands of Junco-Molinion vegetation, continuing the floristic trend seen within the Ericetum itself in the Succisa-Carex sub community. Then, in some of the 'mixed mires' developed on north Norfolk commons like Roydon, there can be a much more striking switch to a more calcicolous series of vegetation types, including the Cirsio-Molinietum, the Schoenetum, tail-herb Phragmitetalia fen and carr (Rose 1953, Daniels & Pearson 1974, Wheeler 1975). Further north in Britain, these kinds of valley mire zonations become rare and the Ericetum often occurs in what is essentially a reverse sequence of communities, giving way above to ombrogenous mire on deeper, wetter blanket peat, generally within the range of the Ericetum, the Calluna-Eriophorum mire; and passing below to a variety of northern dry heaths, throughout which burning has often resulted in a fairly uniform predominance of Calluna, or which have run down to Nardo-Galion grasslands with much Juncus squarrosus and Nardus stricta. Where relaxation of burning and grazing allows invasion of shrubs and trees, the Ericetum is probably rapidly converted to woodland. Although this process has not been followed in detail, the most natural successor to the community is likely to be the Betula-Molinia woodland, Betula pubescens and Salix cinerea leading the colonisation and Pinus sylvestris sometimes making a prominent local contribution where it can readily seed in from nearby plantations. Molinia continues to play a major role in the field layer of this woodland, though the ericoids persist only patchily in areas with a more open canopy. Draining can probably speed up this succession, though it may allow a phase of strong Molinia-dominance to supervene between the heath and the woodland. In time, the Betula-Molinia woodland may give way to the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland. Combinations of frequent burning, draining and damage due to other operations like military manoeuvres and mineral extraction have led to an irretrievable loss of the Ericetum in many areas (Rose 1953, Ratcliffe 1977). Even where stands survive intact, the characteristic zonations in which the vegetation occurs have been truncated and the community can now often be found closely hemmed in by coniferous plan tations or intensive agricultural land (e.g. Moore 1962). Distribution "
"m17","Zonation and succession Zonations between the different kinds of Scirpus-Eriophorum mire and to other vegetation types are most often related to the height of the water-table and the degree of soligenous influence within stretches of blanket peat. Effects of treatment can overlie such transitions and they may precipitate a run-down of the vegetation through wet heath to dry heath and grassland. Without disturbance or any natural shift in the extreme oceanic conditions, the community subsists as a climatic climax. Internal vegetational patterning on virgin tracts of oceanic blanket bog is most commonly related to the differentiation of surface microrelief. Then, the Drosera-Sphagnum sub-community occupies the bulk of the wetter ground, with the Cladonia sub-community pick ing out the tops of the drier hummocks, and Rhynchos-porion vegetation occurring in the pools. Typically, within the range of the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire, this latter is represented by the Sphagnum auriculatum community: species like Eriophorum angustifolium, Molinia, Narthecium and Drosera rotundifolia may run some way into this vegetation, but there is a pronounced shift in the Sphagnum carpet to dominance of S. auriculatum and S. cuspidatum and stands are commonly marked by a fringe of Rhynchospora alba. It is in this kind of situation that species such as Hammarbya paludosa and Scheuchzeria palustris are recorded within tracts of Scirpus-Eriophorum mire. The clarity of differentiation of these pools, and the proportion of the mire surface occupied by their Rhynchosporion vegetation, vary considerably: they are best developed and most extensive in the zone with more than 200 wet days yr 1, becoming less important in the southern part of the range of the community, as in Wales and on Dartmoor (Lindsay et al. 1984). But, even in the far north-west, their occurrence is quite variable and seems to be related to local accumulation of waters over depressions in the underlying ground or where there is channelling from the mire surrounds. Quite commonly, it is in just such situations that the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire approaches most closely to the Erica-Sphagnum papillosum mire, and is sometimes replaced by it (as in certain of the Silver Flowe mires: Ratcliffe & Walker 1958). The relationships between the two communities in these habitats, which are transitional between blanket and raised bogs, need further investigation. Where there is a thinning of the cover of blanket peat and better drainage, as on steeper ground around valley bottoms or where plateaus give way to fringing hills above or slopes below, the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire is typically replaced throughout its range by the Scirpus-Erica wet heath. Some important vascular species, like Scirpus, Molinia, Calluna and E. tetralix, run on into this vegetation and their dominance throughout may mask other floristic changes, but Eriophorum vaginatum declines greatly in frequency, the Sphagnum carpet loses its variety and luxuriance, and any differentiation of surface relief is lost as the peat cover becomes drier and thinner. Such zonations can be quite abrupt where there is a fairly marked change of slope, but often they are gradual and the Sphagnum sub-community of the Scir pus-Erica wet heath, with its modest frequencies of S. papillosum and E. vaginatum, may then form a tran sitional zone. And the relative proportions of the two communities vary with regional climate and local topographical modification of it: in drier areas or on southfacing slopes, the whole sequence tends to move downslope, the mire becoming more confined to the flattest ground, the wet heath more extensive. Such general zonations are complicated by soligenous influence which tends to cut across the transitions down the lines of steeper slope. Most often, in these oceanic https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.021 Published online by Cambridge University Press178 Mires blanket mires, areas of more pronounced seepage are marked by the Carex sub-community of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath, which can form quite extensive stands over slopes with some through-put or narrow, sinuous strips along obvious soakways. These can run through both the wet heath and the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire and then out of the bog along the silty margins of streams. They are frequently marked by a local dominance of Molinia and Myrica but more open stands can provide the most usual locus for Schoenus nigricans within British blanket mire. Altitudinal zonations from the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire to the Calluna-Eriophorum mire are not very fre quent because low-and high-level stretches of flatter ground are often separated by intervening slopes: in the north-west Highlands, for example, the two communities are separated by a zone of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath on better-drained blanket peat. But, in some places, generally between 300 and 450 m, the two can grade imperceptibly one into the other and, in eastern Scotland particularly, the Juncus-Rhytidiadelphus sub community represents an intermediate kind of blanket mire. Treatments, among which burning has probably been of special importance, can modify all these kinds of zonations and induce successional changes in the Scir pus-Eriophorum mire. In some cases, where differences of surface-drainage are very marked, burning may actually sharpen up the vegetation boundaries by allowing different species to gain ascendancy on wetter or drier ground: Eriophorum vaginatum, for example, may become locally dominant after fire in the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire but not in the adjoining heath. In other cases, burning may impose a fairly uniform dominance of Scirpus or Molinia throughout the sequence, blurring zonations among the associates, and some tracts of such fire-climax vegetation may have been partly or wholly derived from the community. But, apart from such modifications of dominance, burning has probably played a major part, along with marginal peat-cutting and draining, in the surfacedrying of the peats that precipitates more dramatic changes in the vegetation. The Cladonia sub-community can represent the first stage in such a development which, with the final elimination of E. vaginatum and further impoverishment of the Sphagnum carpet, perhaps moves to the Cladonia sub-community of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath. Erica cinerea is the potential vascular dominant that seems to gain ascendancy on such drying peats in more oceanic regions (e.g. Goode & Lindsay 1979, Hulme & Blyth 1984) and Calluna-Erica heath may represent an end point in such a run-down. At higher altitudes, in areas with a somewhat drier climate, an analogous trend may involve the conversion of the Juncus-Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire to the Vaccinium sub community of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath, where Vaccinium myrtillus can become an important sub-shrub, perhaps presaging a switch to Calluna-Vaccinium heath. Certainly, complex mosaics of intermediate stages in such processes, approximating to various kinds of Scir pus-Erica heath, with fragments of Scirpus-Eriophorum mire, are of widespread occurrence on deeper peats that would naturally be expected to be clothed with extensive tracts of the latter. Grazing and improvement may take the process further beyond the dry-heath phase to grasslands of various kinds: on Lewis, for example, the crofting townships are fringed by Junco-Molinion swards and Lolio-Cynosuretum that have been derived from blanket mire by top-sowing and the addition of shell-sand and ratio fertilisers (Hulme & Blyth 1984). It is possible that natural climatic change has played some part in the degeneration of blanket peats occupied by the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire. This kind of ombrogenous bog appears to have been initiated locally at the Boreal/Atlantic transition about 7000 years ago and to have resumed rapid growth following climatic deterioration between 600 bc to 500 ad, often spreading to replace forest, tree stumps of which are frequently preserved beneath the peat. However, despite some subsequent amelioration of the climate, it probably remains a climax vegetation type in more oceanic parts of the country. Distribution "
"m18","Zonation and succession Zonations between the sub-communities of the Erica-Sphagnum mire are related to the height of the watertable and transitions to other vegetation types to the degree of stagnation and to the extent of soligenous influence. Treatments can modify these patterns greatly and permit the replacement of the community by other herbaceous vegetation or by woodland. Internal patterning within virgin stands of the Erica-Sphagnum mire characteristically reflects the differentiation of surface microrelief. As noted above, this is generally less pronounced than in the more oceanic Scirpus-Eriophorum mire, though it shows some variation with climate and also with the size of the bog. Often https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.022 Published online by Cambridge University PressM18 Erica tetralix-Sphagnum papillosum raised and blanket mire 189 the Sphagnum-Andromeda sub-community predominates over extensive wet lawns, with the Empetrum-Cladonia sub-community marking out raised areas, frequently slight and of irregular disposition, in other cases more prominent and ordered, with a clearer zonation among the plants in relation to the height of the water-table. Where pools occur in the hollows, there are transitions from the Sphagnum-Andromeda sub community to Rhynchosporion vegetation, with a shift in the Sphagnum carpet to semi-aquatic species and a reduction in many of the vascular plants characteristic of the mire plane, notably Calluna, Scirpus and E. vaginatum. As on the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire, a fringe of Rhynchospora alba often marks this switch, but here the Rhynchosporion vegetation is typically represented by the Sphagnum cuspidatum!recurvum community, the Sphagnum auriculatum type of bog pool generally being confined to sites in areas with a somewhat more oceanic climate, where the mire vegetation itself is of a tran sitional character (as on the Silver Flo we: Ratcliffe & Walker 1958). Usually, S. cuspidatum is the predominant pool species but, where mire surfaces have become eutrophicated, S. recurvum often becomes abundant (see below). Natural zonations from the Erica-Sphagnum mire to other vegetation types are often related to the degree of stagnation in the peats and, on raised bogs, this characteristically lessens towards the margins where there is a more steeply-sloping surround or rand of sometimes considerable width. Over this, the freely-drained conditions exclude the Erica-Sphagnum mire and it is typi cally replaced by vegetation in which Molinia is the leading species, a pattern well seen in the maps and transects of Cors Goch glan Teifi (Godwin & Conway 1939) and some of the Silver Flowe mires (Ratcliffe & Walker 1958, Boatman et al. 1981). The overwhelming dominance of Molinia, and the consequent exclusion of associates from this zone, sometimes make it difficult to determine the exact character of this vegetation but it can usually be referred to the Junco-Molinion. Gradations between this and the Erica-Sphagnum mire of the bog dome are rarely abrupt and transitional vegetation can sometimes be clearly identified as Scirpus-Erica wet heath, often the Sphagnum sub-community which has some representation of Sphagnetalia species (as in the 'intermediate bog' of Ratcliffe & Walker 1958). Else where, such gradual transitions can be incorporated within the Erica-Sphagnum mire itself, the change being essentially confined to gentle shifts of dominance as the rand is approached (Figure 16). Rands are sometimes dissected by erosion channels in which there is some clear soligenous influence but, in normal circumstances, these do not eat back on to the bog dome itself and direct transitions from the Erica-Sphagnum mire to soligenous mires are rare on raised bogs. Nonetheless, the distinctive vegetation of the lagg zone beyond the rand is an integral part of the large-scale pattern in this kind of habitat and it is typically some kind of Caricion nigrae poor fen, often the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire, with some invasion by woody Figure 16. Changes in raised mire zonations from more natural sequence of communities (foreground) to that on drying bog surfaces (background).

This type of pattern can be seen at Cors Fochno, Rhos Goch and Glasson Moss. Where the Erica-Sphagnum mire is represented on basin mires, the community can be found in closer juxtaposition with both soligenous and topogenous vegetation which, with some base-and/or nutrientenrichment from the incoming waters, often shows a slight shift towards a more calcicolous or eutrophic character. At Llyn in Powys, for example, Cors Graia-nog in Gwynedd and Cumwhitton, the Erica-Sphagnum mire occurs with the Potentillo-Caricetum and there are sometimes close associations with the Car ex-Sphagnum warnstorfii or Car ex-Sphagnum squarrosum mires or even with vegetation approaching the Carex-Calliergon mire, again with varying colonisation by Salix spp. and Betula pubescens. Where the Erica-Sphagnum mire occurs in conditions approaching those of blanket bog, the vegetation pat tern may preserve some features of the raised mire system, with a rand on most of the circumference, or just on one side (as on Snibe and Brishie bogs, respectively, in the Silver Flowe complex: Ratcliffe & Walker 1958), passing gradually over its other edges to blanket mire proper or, where there is a transition to steeper valleyside slopes, to Scirpus-Erica wet heath on thinner, drier peats. In other cases, ill-defined patches of the Erica-Sphagnum mire occur embedded within tracts of blanket bog where the peat mantle deepens over cols or sub surface hollows. Usually, at the lower altitudes of which the community is characteristic, it is the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire which provides the context, as in southern Scottish sites like Mochrum Lochs and Kilquhockadale Flow (Ratcliffe 1977, Bignal & Curtis 1981), though towards the Pennines and particularly at higher alti tudes, this is replaced by the Calluna-Eriophorum mire, as around Irthinghead on the Cumbria/Northumber-land border, on Stainmore (Pearsall 1941) and at Moor House (Eddy et al. 1969). At lower levels soligenous soaks can sometimes be found in close association with the Erica-Sphagnum mire, with a cover of the Carex sub community of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath or some type of Carex e chinât a-Sphagnum mire. At higher altitudes, surface erosion features are sometimes found with systems of gullies fretting the surface and the Erio phorum angustifolium community in pools. Such zonations as these have been very widely affected by treatments, particularly at lower altitudes where there has been a long history of local, but sometimes intensive, exploitation of peatlands and where many raised and basin mires now remain, much modified and safeguarded only by statutory protection, within intensive agricultural landscapes. The influences of treat ments have been very diverse, partly because histories of interference have been complex, and partly because different communities in the vegetation patterns are affected in different ways by peat-cutting, burning and draining. But some general effects can be discerned. First, lowering of the water-table, and surface-damage by burning on raised and basin mires, tend to shift the balance within the Erica-Sphagnum mire towards the Empetrum-Cladonia sub-community and sometimes towards more overwhelming dominance by Calluna, E. vaginatum, Scirpus or, increasing beyond its usual low cover here, Molinia. Such changes can occur over entire mire surfaces but they often show first around the margins, where the rand vegetation extends its cover inwards, and at the centre, such that the Erica-Sphagnum mire is reduced to a narrowing ring. Increasing climatic dryness makes raised mires particularly sus ceptible to such modifications (Godwin & Conway 1939). Continuations of such a trend would be expected to convert the Erica-Sphagnum mire to the Scirpus-Erica wet heath with the loss of Eriophorum vaginatum and the luxuriant Sphagnum lawns, but particular sites often show a complex patchwork of vegetation intermediate between the two, with local dominance of ericoids, Scirpus and Molinia, the balance between which is also affected by burning and grazing. Establishment of dry Calluno-Ulicetalia heath may follow but, very com monly, once the surface has ceased to be waterlogged, invasion by woody plants supervenes. Betula pubescens (with B. pendula on drier peats) and Pinus sylvestris are the major colonisers. The former can come to dominate in Betula-Molinia woodland or, where drying out has proceeded further, in birch-dominated stands of the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland. The pine, though usually seeding in from plantation stock, can form a canopy to vegetation very similar to the natural Pinus-Hylocomium woodland in which E. tetralix or Empe-trum can persist under more open covers and where such characteristic species as Pyrola minor or Listera cordata sometimes appear. Pine woodland of this kind can be seen colonising the community at Moorthwaite Moss and Kirkconnell Flow. Second, peat-cutting often contributes to the surface drying of raised and basin mires but it also results in patterns of its own which fret the bog surface with systems of hollows and baulks. Where the hydrological regime has not been too grossly disrupted, such uneven ground may preserve something of the natural pattern of virgin mires, with the two sub-communities disposed according to the wetness of the ground, but with an artificial regularity over the surface. Often, however, the impact has been more drastic, so that complex mosaics of secondarily-developed communities remain, with poor fens,wet and dry heath, bracken stands and Salix https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.022 Published online by Cambridge University PressM18 Erica tetralix-Sphagnum papillosum raised and blanket mire 191 and birch woodland all jumbled together: this is well shown over parts of the Somerset Levels and on Thorne Waste. Eutrophication of the mire surface or of the ground waters around is often an attendant feature of such gross disturbance and even sites which have remained reasonably intact can show marked effects of enrichment from, for example, fertiliser run-off or drift. This is especially prevalent in some of the Cheshire and Shropshire mires, where it has resulted in a spread of Sphagnum recurvum, from its usual confines in pools over extensive wet lawns in which the Sphagnum-Andromeda sub-community of the Erica-Sphagnum mire is reduced to scattered (though sometimes apparently actively-growing) patches on slightly raised areas (Sinker 1962, Green & Pearson 1968, Tallis 1973tz). Stratigraphical studies clearly show that, in raised and basin mires, vegetation of the Erica-Sphagnum type has developed as the climax of a hydroserai succession, the commonest sequence of which has been open water, swamp, fen, woodland and bog, the stages to fen often taking less than 1000 years, the later phases sometimes much longer (e.g. Walker 1970). Although there is evidence in the peats of periods of drier climate since the initiation of ombrogenous accumulation, the community seems to persist on active surfaces at the present time, provided treatments are not too disruptive of the hydro-logical regime. Distribution "
"m19","Zonation and succession The Calluna-Eriophorum mire is characteristically found in zonations and mosaics with wet and dry heaths and grasslands over sequences of increasingly better-drained soils, with soligenous mires often interrupting the pat terns where there is local flushing and sometimes relieving the prevailingly calcifuge nature of the vegetation cover. Almost universally, such transitions have been affected by treatments, which can blur the boundaries between the vegetation types, encourage some succes-sional changes among them and introduce new elements of variation, particularly striking where these factors contribute to gross erosion of the peat. The basic edaphically-related pattern is best seen where there is a gradual thinning of the ombrogenous peat cover to a humic top over gleyed podzols and then a thin layer of mor over freely-draining podzols, where the Calluna-Eriophorum mire gives way first to Ericetalia heath, then to Calluno-Ulicetalia heath and/or Nardetalia grasslands. Typically, such sequences are disposed over ground of progressively increasing slope, running downhill where the blanket bog occupies the summits of hills (a frequent occurrence here), running uphill where it clothes valley bottoms and plateaus which give way above to a fringe of steeper ground. The transitions may be on a grand scale, where more or less flat land is a prevailing element in the scenery, as is the case in parts of the Central Highlands, over the rounded summits of the Cheviot and on the high Pennines, where the communities can show a crude altitudinal pattern of replacement one by the other. But, in more rugged terrain, the zonations are on a finer scale, with repeated sequences over the stepped landscapes of grits and shales, for example, or complex mosaics disposed over craggy ground with small boulders. And, as in similar transitions with the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire, regional and local climate can influence the proportions of the com munities that are represented, with the wetter elements of the sequence extended on to somewhat steeper slopes in areas with higher rainfall or on northern aspects, but contracted in drier sites. The particular kinds of Calluna-Eriophorum mire found in these zonations, and the types of heath and grassland, vary with altitude and, where the bog gives way both above and below to such sequences, different heaths and grasslands may be represented in each, though the general physiognomic character of the tran sitions is very similar. The shift to Ericetalia wet heath is thus usually marked by a fairly rapid loss of E. vaginatum and a further reduction in the often already low cover of Sphagna such as S. papillosum in the ground carpet. Where the Calluna-Eriophorum mire extends to lower altitudes in the Erica sub-community, such transitions can be fairly gradual and very like those found around the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire, with the Sphagnum sub-community of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath forming a marginal zone. But, at higher altitudes, where the Calluna-Eriophorum mire is represented by other sub-communities, it is usually drier forms of Ericetalia heath that replace the community as the peat cover thins: often, in such situations, the Vaccinium sub community of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath can be found, but at lower altitudes in eastern Scotland, the Juncus-Dicranum sub-community of the Ericetum tetralicis can mark the transition. In these vegetation types, the most obvious floristic changes, apart from the reduction in E. vaginatum and the Sphagna, are increased vigour among the sub-shrubs, an abundance of Juncus squarrosus and/ or Nardus stricta and the frequent occurrence of acro carpous mosses such as Dicranum scoparium and Cam-pylopus paradoxus, with Racomitrium lanuginosum and lichens often prominent on bare peat. Sometimes, this wet-heath zone is of considerable extent but quite frequently, where the margin of the bog is steep, it is reduced in width or totally absent, with an abrupt switch to dry heath, with overwhelming dominance of Calluna, or one of the Empêtra or Vaccinia. Usually, such vegetation can be included within the Calluna-Vaccinium or Vaccinium-Deschampsia heaths, but, at higher altitudes, the Calluna-Cladonia or Cal luna-Ar ctostaphylos heaths can replace the Calluna-Eriophorum mire on steeper, drier slopes, and these in turn may give way to lichen-or moss-dominated vege tation on very exposed summits. At lower altitudes, the zonation often continues beyond the heaths into some kind of Nardetalia grassland and, quite often, there are direct transitions from the community to these vege tation types with the increasing influence of pastoral agriculture (see below). General patterns of the kinds described above are frequently complicated by the local occurrence of soligenous mires, and sometimes small topogenous basins associated with them. Again, the particular character of this vegetation varies with altitude. At lower levels, through the range of the Erica and Empetrum sub communities, various kinds of Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire, dominated by small sedges or Junci, can be found around flushes and along water-tracks through the bog and into the zones of fringing vegetation. At higher altitudes, this community is replaced in analo-https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.023 Published online by Cambridge University PressM19 Calluna vulgaris-Eriophorum vaginatum blanket mire 205 gous situations by the Carex-Sphagnum russowii mire. Where the flushing waters are somewhat less base-poor, the Carex-Sphagnum warnstorfii mire occurs, or where there is a marked enrichment, as where the blanket bog has encroached over calcareous substrates, the Pinguiculo-Caricetum, Carici-Saxifragetum or Caricetum sax atilis can mark out sites with soligenous influence, with the Carex-Calliergon mire in small waterlogged hollows. Such variegation often provides the floristically most interesting element of internal patterning on the Cal luna-Eriophorum mire, because true hummock/hollow relief, with its distinctive zoning of plants and transitions to Rhynchosporion pools, is only rarely encountered. It is sometimes developed in the Erica sub-community, which can occur within tracts of the Empetrum type where a higher water-table is locally maintained, and then the Rhynchosporion component is generally represented by the Sphagnum cuspidatum /recurvum community. In other cases, the Carex ro str ata-Sphagnum recurvum or Eriophorum angustifolium communities can mark out pools. Much more commonly, internal variation within tracts of the Calluna-Eriophorum mire comprises quantitative differences in the major structural elements developed in response to burning and grazing. If such treatments are drastic and frequent or long-maintained, they can induce more substantial qualitative changes in the vegetation: in some cases, such changes can be reversed but they may initiate a run-down of the community and contribute to the destruction of the underlying peats. Most obviously, frequent burning and heavy grazing contribute to the conversion of the Calluna-Eriophorum mire into the Eriophorum mire, where ericoids, Sphagna and hypnaceous mosses are of very patchy occurrence and E. vaginatum overwhelmingly dominant. Locally-extensive tracts of this impoverished vegetation can be found through much of the range of the Calluna-Eriophorum mire, though reversion to the richer blanket bog has been demonstrated after only 15 years of enclosure and freedom from burning at Moor House (Rawes 1983). In the southern Pennines, however, where injudicious treatments have been combined with draining and aerial pollution over the past two centuries, the degeneration of the Calluna-Eriophorum mire is particularly widespread and perhaps irremediable. Here, too, erosion of the peats is especially severe, with much bare peat even among the remnants of the richer blanket bog, patchy Eriophorum angustifolium pools occurring where water collects and soligenous vegetation approximating to the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire marking out gullies with some moderate water movement. Similar mosaics are very well seen in the map of Moor House in Eddy et al. (1969). In other cases, treatments can convert the Calluna-Eriophorum mire into heath or grassland. The peats here are already fairly dry, so it is often a small step, with artificial drainage, to encourage a succession to wet heath, a change marked most obviously by a reduction in the vigour of E. vaginatum, and then to dry heath, with its overwhelming dominance of ericoids. Combined with grazing, such treatment can produce a Nar detalia sward or, with liming and fertiliser application, even something approximating to a Cynosurion pas ture. With less assiduous improvement, Juncus squarrosus often gains an opportunity to spread in such situations, though enclosure of a Jwwa/s-dominated pasture at Moor House showed that such a trend could be reversed, the vegetation beginning to develop into Cal luna-Eriophorum mire after 25 years (Rawes 1981). The recent subsidising of improvement of hill-grazings has greatly speeded the reclamation of this kind of blanket bog for agriculture and rendered such changes more permanent. In other places, draining has been a prelude to afforestation. Distribution "
"m2","Zonation and succession The Sphagnum cuspidatumIrecurvum community is typi cally found as the pool, wet hollow or lawn component in the Erica-Sphagnum mire, grading to drier flat and hummock vegetation with increasing height above the water-table. There is some evidence that such patterns may represent cyclical regeneration complexes but such succession may be extremely slow and, on drained mires, the community may remain as a fragment of the pre viously active surface or in artificial pools among run down wet heath and woodland. A typical zonation on an active raised mire runs from the Rhynchospora sub-community through the Sphagnum-Andromeda sub-community of the Erica-Sphagnum mire on the flats to the Empetrum-Cladonia sub community on the hummock sides and tops. In the Sphagnum carpet, there is a switch from S. cuspidatum to S. papillosum, S. tenellum and S. magellanicum and thence to 5. capillifolium. Among the vascular plants, Rhynchospora continues only a little way on to the flats, forming a fringe to the pools, but Drosera rotundifolia and, especially noticeable on these mires, Andromeda maintain their frequency in the transition to the Sphagnum-Andromeda sub-community of the mire. Erio phorum angustifolium and Erica tetralix also remain very common and are joined by Eriophorum vaginatum, Calluna and Scirpus cespitosus and these five species contribute the bulk of the vascular cover on the flats and hummocks. The clarity of the sequence and the relative contributions of the different elements vary considerably according to the degree of structural patterning on the mire surface but the general transition is well seen in the series of noda characterised by Bignal & Curtis (1981) from Strathclyde mires and illustrated diagram-matically in Godwin & Conway's (1939) classic study of Cors Goch Gian Teifi. Essentially similar sequences can be found where the community occurs within the Erica-Sphagnum mire on solid and Schwingmoor peats in basins, notably in the Shropshire-Cheshire Plain, though here it is now most often represented by the Sphagnum recurvum sub community which tends to be the dominant element in extensive lawns with rather poor internal structural differentiation. A range of zonations with different degrees of clarity is well described in Tallis's (1973a) survey of these sites and the general predominance of S. recurvum throughout such sequences is clearly seen in published profiles of Clarepool Moss (Sinker 1962) and Wybunbury Moss (Green & Pearson 1968). At least some of the hummock/hollow complexes in which this community is found, on active mire surfaces developed under undisturbed conditions, may represent regeneration complexes of the kind described by Osvald (1923; see also Godwin & Conway 1939, Tansley 1939), though stratigraphical evidence suggests that the cyclical pattern of replacement is probably very slow, pro ceeding over centuries. In such situations, the Rhynchospora sub-community is probably the more natural kind of Sphagnum cuspidatum!recurvum bog pool with the Sphagnum recurvum sub-community playing a minor role and particularly associated with areas of soligenous influence. With increased disturbance and modest eutrophication of mire surfaces, however, the latter sub community has become more frequent, not only in scattered flooded peat workings, but also more extensively where mires have been subject to increased input of enriched waters from surrounding land. In the basin mires of Shropshire and Cheshire, this seems to have been a fairly recent process attendant upon agricultural improvement of the surrounding land and, in some cases, the decay of old drainage systems on the mires (Sinker 1962, Green & Pearson 1968, 1977, Tallis https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.006 Published online by Cambridge University Press54 Mires 1973a). At some sites, renewed growth of the Sphagnum carpet under such conditions has caused a reversion from the heath and woodland of the once-drained surfaces. Where drainage has proceeded without this kind of interruption, the Sphagnum cuspidatum!recurvum bog pools have been progressively reduced with conversion of the mire surface to Ericion tetralicis wet heath. Fragments may remain within tracts of the Scirpus-Erica or Ericetum tetralicis wet heaths, generally dominated by mixtures of Molinia, Scirpus or ericoids (e.g. Sinker 1962, Tallis 1973#) or among developing woodland, usually birch-or pine-dominated stands of the Betula-Molinia woodland, on the drying peats (e.g. Sinker 1962, Green & Pearson 1968, Ratcliffe 1977). Distribution "
"m20","Zonation and succession The Eriophorum mire is typically found as a replacement for the Calluna-Eriophorum mire (less often for the Erica-Sphagnum mire) in zonations and mosaics with heaths and grasslands over sequences of increasingly better-drained soils, with soligenous mires reflecting the occurrence of local flushing. The extent of replacement and the clarity of the boundaries between the community and remaining tracts of the original mire vegetation, depend largely on the intensity of the various factors mediating their interconversion. Such treatments can also affect transitions to neighbouring vegetation types and they have contributed widely to the degradation of entire landscapes in which the community is found. Around the margins of blanket bogs, on which the https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.024 Published online by Cambridge University PressM20 Eriophorum vaginatum blanket and raised mire 215 Eriophorum mire most commonly occurs, the thinning of the peat cover is generally marked by a transition to Ericetalia wet heath over gleyed podzols, or Calluno-Ulicetalia heath or Nardetalia grasslands over more free-draining podzols or rankers. Typically, such zonations occur over progressively steepening slopes, usually running downhill from summit plateaus, or sometimes uphill, where flat, peat-covered ground gives way above to rougher terrain. In the south Pennines, these sequences are seen on a grand scale, forming a crude altitudinal pattern, with local reversals where resistant grits are exposed in lines of crags (e.g. Smith & Moss 1903, Moss 1913). The kind of Ericetalia community most often found in association with the Eriophorum mire on blanket bog fringes seems to be the Juncus-Dicranum sub-community of the Ericetum tetralicis wet heath. This may be of considerable extent where the peat thins gradually or has been eroded into substantial amounts of downwash, but around abrupt mire margins this zone is often curtailed. Then, there may be a more or less direct switch to Calluno-Ulicetalia vegetation, usually some form of Calluna-Vaccinium or Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath. Very commonly, however, the grazing which plays a major part in the development of the Eriophorum mire itself, has converted some or all of this heath vegetation to grassland, leaving strips of sub-shrub vegetation confined to more inaccessible crags and tumbles of boulders below them: this is well seen in the southern Pennines (e.g. Lewis & Moss 1911, Moss 1913). In the poor-quality swards that develop on the grazed ground around the mire, Juncus squarrosus often becomes very prominent over the more ill-drained thin peats and peaty podzols, with Nardus stricta a leading species on the drier podzols and rankers: the map of Moor House in Eddy et al. (1969) shows this kind of pattern very clearly. In other cases, as on Ilkley Moor, the unpalatable E. nigrum ssp. nigrum has spread in abundance through most of the zonations around the grazed mire fringes, masking the pattern of communities (Fidler et al. 1970, Dalby et al. 1971). Strips of Juncus-Festuca or Nardus-Galium grassland can also be found running through tracts of the Erio phorum mire where there is very slight flushing of thin peats or exposed mineral soils; and, if the waters show some amelioration of base-deficiency, small stands of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland can occur. Stronger soligenous influence, which maintains the soils in a wetter state, is typically characterised by tracks of Caricion nigrae vegetation, often, at these modest alti tudes, the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire, dominated by small sedges or, very frequently, by Juncus effusus. These flushes may have Cardamino-Montion springs at their source, and they can unite as they flow through the mire and the grasslands around to form distinct streams. More stagnant wet areas within stands of the Erio phorum mire are generally scarce but occasional pools may have species-poor Rhynchosporion vegetation like that of the Eriophorum angustifolium, Sphagnum cuspidatum ! recurvum or Carex rostrata-Sphagnum recurvum communities. Two other kinds of surface patterning can be found where the Eriophorum mire occurs on blanket bogs. Quite commonly, the community is seen in mosaics with the Calluna-Eriophorum mire, the disposition of the two vegetation types and the sharpness of the boundaries between them reflecting the pattern of treatments. Sometimes, the separation of the two along a fence-line provides striking testimony to the importance of grazing in mediating change between them, but often the transitions are less well defined, reflecting gradual reductions in grazing intensity, for example, in moving away from adjacent stretches of more palatable grasslands (e.g. Pearsall 1941, Eddy et al. 1969, Rawes 1983). In certain cases, zonations between the two communities may be temporary, their boundaries shifting with variations in grazing or where there is recovery after burning. And, even where the existence of Eriophorum mire seems to be well established, it has been shown that the process of impoverishment can be reversed: at Moor House, enclosure and freedom from burning has allowed a convincing progression back to Calluna-Eriophorum mire within the space of 25 years (Rawes 1983). Enclosed Juncus squarrosus swards there, perhaps der ived by very heavy grazing of blanket mire on thinner peats, have also begun to show the same development (Rawes 1981). It is very doubtful whether the Eriophorum mire so common throughout the southern Pennines could show the same kind of recovery, for here, quite apart from the very thorough floristic impoverishment, there is particularly severe erosion of the underlying peats. This introduces a further element of patterning into the vegetation cover, fragmenting the Eriophorum mire itself and lead ing to the development of mosaics of the two sub communities over the more intact haggs and their wasting margins. It can also precipitate a progression from the Calluna-Cladonia sub-community to dry heath along the freely-draining tops of the drainage channels and tumbling masses of dry peat over their sides and, where there is extensive marginal wasting, lead to a replacement of mire vegetation by Juncus-Festuca grassland over the redistributed materials. Sometimes, there is very patchy regeneration of the mire within more gently-sloping channels, or where their blockage has induced some stagnation, but usually, where these are not entirely bare, they contain fragments of Caricion nigrae vegetation like the Carex echinata-Sphagnum https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.024 Published online by Cambridge University Press216 Mires mire, extending back, as erosion progresses, into the heart of the bog. Where the Eriophorum mire occurs more locally on raised bogs, it generally appears to replace the Erica-Sphagnum mire and may form a mosaic with surviving fragments of this where treatment has not been so thoroughgoing. Around the mire margins, there is typi cally a transition to Junco-Molinion vegetation on the rand, with overwhelming dominance of E. vaginatum passing to equally uncompromising dominance of Molinia caerulea. In much-disturbed situations, the lagg vegetation beyond this may become markedly eutrophi-cated but, in some sites, impoverished Eriophorum mire occurs in close contact with a rich assemblage of soligenous vegetation, as at Malham Tarn (Sinker 1960, Proctor 1974, Adam et al. 1975). Drying of the peats under the community in raised bogs, often accentuated by peat-cutting and draining, can favour a spread of Junco-Molinion vegetation which, with removal of grazing, can progress to Betula-Molinia woodland. Distribution "
"m21","Zonation and succession The Narthecio-Sphagnetum occurs in mosaics and zonations with other vegetation types in relation to the height of the water-table and the degree of soligenous influence within valley mires, the overall configuration of which is strongly dependent on local topography. With con tinued autogenic accumulation of peats, the community probably progresses naturally to some kind of woodland and draining may speed this succession. Often, however, together with burning and grazing, it has led to degradation of the vegetation. The fully-developed sequence of communities in which the Narthecio-Sphagnetum occurs is very distinctive (e.g. Rose 1953, Newbould 1960, Ivimey-Cook et al. 1975, Wheeler 1983). First, within tracts of the community itself, there can be some measure of surface-relief, with a patterned distribution of the Sphagna and vascular plants over drier and wetter ground and transitions to Rhynchosporion vegetation in pools proper. Characteristically, this latter is of the Sphagnum auriculatum type, the pools often surrounded by a zone of Rhynchospora alba (sometimes with R. fused) and showing a switch to dominance of S. auriculatum and S. cuspidatum in the ground carpet, with an appearance of plants like Menyanthes trifoliata, Potamogeton polygonifolius and Utricularia spp. It is in the transition zone to such pools that Hammarbya typically occurs. https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.025 Published online by Cambridge University PressM21 Narthecio-Sphagnetum valley mire 223 Where such wetter areas show some measure of soligenous influence, Littorelletea vegetation is often found, with P. polygonifolius, Eleocharis multicaulis, Juncus bulbosus[fluitans and Hypericum elodes. These can mark out small seepage areas around the edge of the Narthecio-Sphagnetum or water-tracks within stretches of the mire, but quite often the Littorelletea vegetation forms a distinct zone inward of the Narthecio-Sphagnetum towards the central mire axis. Continuing this zonation towards the zone of maximal soligenous influence, there can be a strip of Caricion nigrae poor fen and then a central line of Betula-Molinia woodland; in valley mires with somewhat more base-and nutrientenrichment, the last two may be replaced by Caricetum paniculatae swamp and Alnus-Carex woodland (Figure 17). In the opposite direction, towards the fringes of the mire, the Narthecio-Sphagnetum typically gives way to the Ericetum tetralicis. With the move to the periodically-waterlogged shallow peats and peaty gleys that cover the surrounding slopes, the carpet of luxuriant Sphagnum papillosum is replaced by patchy S. compactum and S. tenellum, species such as Er iophorum angusti-folium, Narthecium and Drosera rotundifolia thin out and the canopy of ericoids becomes denser. Small patches of wet sandy peat in the transition zone are sometimes picked out by the striking Rhynchospora-Drosera sub-community of the Ericetum, with its occasional Lepidotis inundata and crusts of the purple alga Zygogonium ericetorum s.l. Beyond the wet heath, the basic sequence continues into dry Calluno-Ulicetalia heath of some kind. Complete zonations of this type are best seen in some of the New Forest valley mires, as at Wilverley, Holms-ley and Matley bogs and in the Denny/Shatterford system (Rose 1953, Tubbs 1968, Ratcliffe 1977, NCC New Forest Bogs Report 1984), and on certain south Dorset heaths (Ratcliffe 1977). In other sites, the sequence of communities is incomplete because of differences in topography and hydrology: at Thursley Common, in Surrey, for example, the Narthecio-Sphagnetum terminates the zonation below, forming a rather extensive stretch of bog like a raised mire (Rose 1953, Ratcliffe 1977) and on Aylesbeare Common, in Devon, stretches of the community mark out more strongly waterlogged ground over gently-undulating topography with a complex mosaic of wet and dry heaths (Ivimey-Cook et al. W15). Quite frequently, too, the general zonation is complicated by the occurrence of other vegetation types which reflect differences in base-or nutrient-richness of the substrates and waters. Tracts of Junco-Molinion grasslands, sometimes dominated by Myrica, can be found at some sites below the Narthecio-Sphagnetum, where soli genous influence increases, or cutting through it, where there is some channelling of flow down the slopes (Ivimey-Cook et al. 1975). Then, in certain New Forest mires, notably at Cranesmoor (Newbould 1960), on Figure 17. Zonation around a typical lowland valley bog in southern England. M6 Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire Ml6a Ericetum tetralicis wet heath, Typical sub-community M2 la Narthecio-Sphagnetum valley bog, Sphagnum-Rhynchospora sub-community M29 Hyperico-Potametum soakway W4 Betula-Molinia woodland H2 Calluna-Ulex minor heath H3 Ulex minor-Agrostis heath https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.025 Published online by Cambridge University Press224 Mires Hartland Moor in Dorset (Ratcliffe 1977) and at Ayles-beare (Ivimey-Cook et al. 1975), the Narthecio-Sphagnetum gives way to the Schoenus-Narthecium community along the central mire axis. In the 'mixed mires' found on some north Norfolk commons, like Roydon, where valleys have cut down through sands and gravels to Chalky Boulder Clay, there is a more marked shift from the community to calcicolous fen-meadow and fen, with vegetation types like the Cirsio-Molinietum and Schoenetum bordering the mire axis (Rose 1953, Daniels & Pearson 1974, Wheeler 1975). Towards the north and west, there is an increasing tendency for the Narthecio-Sphagnetum to be less well characterised floristically and for stands to survive in fragmentary form within much-altered landscapes. Even in the south-east, treatments have had some dras tic effects and losses of the community, with heathland reclamation, have probably been extensive. Severe fires sometimes cause local damage to the Sphagnum carpet with a run-down of the vegetation to the Ericetum tetralicis and, where stock are turned on to the community in large numbers, trampling and manuring may precipitate a succession to poor fen (Rose 1953). But draining has been particularly destructive and, even where this has not been followed by improvement for agriculture or forestry, it has induced substantial changes. Essentially, it speeds up what is probably naturally a rather slow process of surface-drying with autogenic peat accumulation: lowering the water-table encourages the invasion of woody plants, among which Betula spp. and Pinus sylvestris are generally prominent, and makes the vegetation more susceptible to the effects of burning. Under such conditions, what was once Narthecio-Sphagnetum often presents a sorry spectacle of scrubby woodland and impoverished Ericetum and dry heaths.Distribution "
"m22","Zonation and succession The Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadow is found with a wide variety of swamps, tail-herb fens, other mires and grasslands and woodlands in zonations and mosaics which reflect interactions between edaphic variation and treatments. Many such sequences now bear signs of neglect or disturbance and are often truncated above by im provement of the soils, occurring as isolated fragments within intensive agricultural landscapes. The abandonment of traditional treatments has also allowed many tracts to progress to scrub or woodland in renewed successions. The most extensive sequences in which the Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadow is found occur in large topogenous mires, like the flood-plain fens of Broadland, where the Iris sub-community once formed an important part of the patchwork of mowing-marsh. Concentrated on the drier fen margins and maintained by annual summercutting for litter, such vegetation typically gave way over the more extensively-flooded peats to the Peucedano-Phragmitetum or the more species-poor Phragmites-Eupatorium fen, different compartments variously treated for crops of Phragmites, Cladium or Glyceria maxima, according to the timing of mowing and the trophic state of the substrates. And, beyond such com munities, around the open waters, and penetrating between the compartments along the actively-maintained dykes, were stands of swamps, such as the Phragmitetum, the Glycerietum maximae or the Cladie-tum (Pallis 1911, Lambert 1946, 1951, 1965). Such vegetation patterns are now in a state of almost universal neglect, with the various dominants reasserting themselves strongly among the secondary fen and Phragmites re-invading the fen-meadows (Wheeler 1975). The boundaries between the fen compartments have been further obscured by the choking of dykes and by the invasion throughout of shrubs and trees. Most of the developing woodland approximates to Salix-Betula-Phragmites fen carr, the kind of wet forest which develops in most primary hydrarch successions over more base-rich peats in lowland Britain, and towards which secondary successions tend to converge when restraining treatments are withdrawn (Figure 18).In some stretches of Broadland, around Hickling, Sutton and Wheatfen broads, for example (Wheeler 1975), such mosaics as these can still be seen in less obscured form and at Wicken Fen some of the mown droves have thin strips of this kind of Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadow running between the compartments. Else where, smaller fen basins, like those in Norfolk and Anglesey, and alluvial terraces along chalkland streams, have narrow sequences of fen-meadow, fen and swamp of this basic type. Spring-fed hollows in East Anglia, too, can show compressed zonations from the Caricetum elatae swamp to the Carex elata sub community. In such cases, grazing often maintains a short sward, although larger sedge tussocks may provide a niche for the scattered invasion of woody plants. Although grazed Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadow was once an extensive component of the vegetation cover on some flood-plain mires, forming a striking contrast to the mowing-marsh around (Lambert 1948), it is now generally found as small stands marking out waterlogged hollows, seepage lines and springs within enclosed pastures. Where stock penetrate far and regularly on to the wetter ground, the vegetation is usually of the Briza-Trifolium type, although there can be con siderable floristic and structural differences both within and between stands according to the pattern of flushing and the intensity of grazing. The sharpness of the boundary between the fen-meadow and surrounding sward is also variable, depending on the gradient of soil moisture and whether there have been attempts to improve the pasture around. Often, the context is a Cynosurion grassland, like the ubiquitous Lolio-Cyno-suretum or, on less-improved ground, the Cemaureo-Cynosuretum, both of them agricultural swards of brown soils with free to moderately impeded drainage such as frequently surround flushes and waterlogged hollows with fen-meadow developed over shale and clay landscapes. With such grasslands, the Briza-Trifolium sub-community shows a strong floristic continuity through mesophytic herbs such as Holcus lanatus, Fes tuca rubra, Ranunculus acris, Trifolium repens, Ceras-tium fontanum, Prunella vulgaris, Centaurea nigra and Cynosurus cristatus, so the general effect in moving out of the flush is of a loss of rush and sedge dominants and Molinietalia herbs and a supplementing of the general Molinio-Arrhenatheretea element with a prominent Cynosurion component. In other cases, where springs or waterlogged hollows punctuate a landscape dominated by pervious limestones with rendzina soils, the floristic switch around the fen-meadow is to a Mesobromion sward, usually of the Festuca-Avenula type, with species such as Briza media, Carex flacca, Centaurea nigra and Trifolium pratense providing a link. Sometimes, where base-richness of the soils is pronounced, such grassland may provide a context for a wider range of wetter https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.026 Published online by Cambridge University PressM22 Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre fen-meadow 235 calcicolous communities around areas of soligenous influence, not only fen-meadow of the Briza-Trifolium type, but also the Schoenetum or, towards northern Britain, the Pinguiculo-Caricetum. In some sites of this type, too, the Cirsio-Molinietum fen-meadow can figure in such mosaics, characteristic of somewhat drier soils than these springs and extending on to less base-rich ones. Its floristic similarity to the Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadow is considerable and in some cases it may have been derived from it by selective nutrient depletion with long-continued treatment. Reduction of grazing in the Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadow results in an expansion of the bulky dominants and ranker grasses and an overwhelming of the smaller herbs, producing vegetation like that of the Typical sub community. Patches of this can often be found within stands of the Briza-Trifolium sub-community, marking out less-frequented areas of ground, which then acquire some resistance to the reduction of the rough herbage which develops. In other cases, whole springs and hollows, more or less totally free of grazing, in field corners or alongside streams, can be occupied by this kind of fen meadow, sharply delineated from the hea vily-cropped pasture around or, where neglect has extended on to drier ground also, grading to some kind of Arrhenatheretum, with plants such as Festuca rubra, Holcus lanatus, Lotus uliginosus, Vicia cracca and Lathy-Figure 18. Changes in fen and meadow zonation with improvement and neglect. In the foreground is a traditional sequence in an openwater transition mire from Phragmitetum swamp (S4), through mown Peucedano-Phragmitetum (S24) and Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadow, Iris sub-community (M22d) to grazed Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadow, Briza-rus pratensis providing some floristic continuity, but dominance passing to Arrhenatherum elatius and Moli-nietalia tall herbs being replaced by Arrhenatherion umbellifers such as Heracleum sphondylium and Anthris-cus sylvestris. Quite often, too, in such situations as this, the soils are sufficiently eutrophic to allow plants such as Epilobium hirsutum and Urtica dioica to gain a hold once grazing is relaxed and dense patches of these may be found among mosaics of these two communities. Indeed, a neat experiment described by Wheeler (19836; see also Wheeler et al. 1985) has shown how an enclosed Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadow was fairly rapidly replaced by dense E. hirsutum, except where pronounced waterlogging of the ground maintained ferrous ions at a level toxic to this tall herb, but still harmless to J. subnodulosus and its associates. Enrichment of ground waters by the washing out of fertilisers, now a very common feature of the lowland agricultural landscape in Britain, is likely to increase this kind of development in ungrazed stands. The Typical sub-community of the Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadow, with its rank herbage, is perhaps rather resistant to rapid invasion by woody plants and succes-sional developments subsequent to withdrawal of graz ing have not been followed. Wetter spring-fens are likely to be invaded by much the same mixture of shrubs and trees as are characteristic colonists in topogenous fen-Trifolium sub-community (M22b) and Centaureo-Cynosuretum (MG5). With enclosure and improvement of the drier ground, the last is converted to Lolio-Cynosuretum (MG6), while neglect of the mowing marsh leads to spread of rank Typical Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadow (M22a) and secondary Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland (W2). https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.026 Published online by Cambridge University Press236 Mires meadow, producing Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland, but even in such cases, many stands are so small as to be probably marked out in subsequent woodland cover by just small patches of willow and birch within predominantly drier vegetation. Stands on ground which is not quite so thoroughly waterlogged would perhaps progress eventually to Fraxinus-Acer-Mercur-ialis woodland, whose Deschampsia cespitosa sub community, when coppiced, produces a field layer which has some floristic similarity to the Juncus-Cirsium fen meadow. Extensive abandonment of ground, where such seral processes might be studied, has in fact been very unusual in the recent decades of vigorous land improvement and very often now, neglected Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadows remain isolated fragments closely hemmed in by much-altered pastures or arable land. Themselves originally of agricultural origin and rarely of spectacular richness, even when less overgrown, they nonetheless frequently provide an important remnant habitat for wetland species which were formerly much more common. Distribution "
"m23","Zonation and succession The Juncus-Cirsium rush-pasture occurs in zonations and mosaics with a variety of grasslands, mires and heaths, the disposition of the vegetation types usually reflecting variations in soil conditions and treatments. The community can subsist in non-intensive agricultural landscapes but improvement has destroyed many stands, or altered or truncated zonations. With neglect, improved swards can revert to this kind of vegetation and the community, in turn, progress to woodland. Around the upland fringes of western Britain, the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture is still an important and extensive component of less-improved grazing land, both within and beyond the limits of enclosure. Its contribution to the vegetation cover in such predominantly pastoral landscapes is dependent on the drainage pattern, controlled by such natural factors as geology and relief, so where there has been no improvement of drainage the disposition and size of stands remain effective markers of the extent of impedence over gentle slopes with impervious substrates. And the commonest type of zonation is then to calcifuge grasslands of one sort or another, with increasing freedom of water move-https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.027 Published online by Cambridge University Press250 Mires ment in the profile, a change often indicated by increase in slope, in other cases by a switch in parent materials, or both. Alternations of shales with pervious sandstones present one kind of underlying geological pattern, fairly common in the palaeozoic deposits of western Britain, but frequently it is the distribution of ill-draining drift, lodged on plateaus, moderate slopes and choking small stream-beds, that controls the occurrence of the community. In edaphic terms, these zonations are usually marked by a change from some sort of gleyed profile under the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture, to a brown podzolic soil or podzol, carrying a Nardo-Galion grassland. With increasingly free drainage, and greater tendency to surface eluviation, the rushes and Molinietalia associates drop out, leaving herbs such as Anthoxanthum, Festuca rubra, Agrostis capillaris and Potentilla erecta, as mainstays of some kind of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland. Junctions can be sharp, where underlying edaphic conditions change suddenly, but often they are fairly gentle, as where drift influence alters gradually or where the penetration of stock creates a transitional mosaic zone between clumps of rushes. The surveys of King (1962; see also King & Nicholson 1964) include some of these intermediate swards from southern Scot land and, in the data from Moor House (Eddy et al. 1969), transitions to grasslands with much Nardus can be seen, a quite widespread feature at such higher altitudes. At this site, too, and also around Cader Idris (Edgell 1969), some of the surrounding swards are flushed with the more base-rich water which gleys the soils under the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture, and here the zonation can be to Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, into which Nardo-Galion herbs and such plants as Carexpanicea, Cirsium palustre and Agrostis canina ssp. canina can extend. Although the Juncus-Cirsium rush-pasture is only slightly mesophytic, transitions such as these probably involve a switch to soils which are somewhat more oligotrophic than the gleys. Within enclosed agricultural land, however, the surrounding swards have often received some fertilising, even if only from the stock which, in this kind of mosaic, give most of their attention to the drier grasslands, or from artificials such as basic slag. Then, a Cynosurion element may become prominent in the transition, with, say the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland surrounding the rush-pasture, or, where there has been more assiduous improvement with some top-sowing, the Anthoxanthum sub-community of the Lolio-Cynosuretum. Cynosurion species may drift into the rush-pasture, blurring the boundaries, and the next stage of improvement is for draining of the gleys to facilitate the extinction of the rushes and their Molinietalia associates and the reclamation of the entire sward. This has been a very widespread practice, particularly over less intractable ground at lower altitudes, and though blocking of drains can allow relatively rapid reversion to the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture, many stands have been permanently destroyed. Beyond the limits of enclosure, where the community can be found at moderate altitudes, the stagnohumic gleys on which it characteristically occurs often form intergrade soils between brown podzolic profiles and peats proper (Avery 1980). In some situations, the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture can thus be seen as part of a more extensive transition right through from Nardo-Galion swards to blanket mire with the thickening of the organic horizon from mor humus, through humose top soil to ombrogenous peat. In such places, the community may be preferentially grazed along with stretches of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium or Nardus-Galium grasslands as the most productive and palatable vegetation types, so the switch to the peat vegetation is often marked by the appearance of ericoids, first in the Scirpus-Erica wet heath, then in Erico-Sphagnion mire. In these kinds of zonations, as at Moor House (Eddy et al. 1969) and on Cader Idris (Edgell 1969) the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture often occurs in quite well-defined stream-side stands running through the tracts of peat. Then, it can be seen as a mesotrophic equivalent to rush-dominated types of Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire. Where such streams are surrounded by gently-flushed stretches of peat, and particularly where the vegetation has been burned over and grazed, Molinia-Potentilla grassland can form an extensive fringe to the community. In the lowland landscape, too, the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture can be found with wet heath and mires on peats, where soligenous conditions develop in ill-draining valley bottoms with gleying of their surrounds. Indeed, within stretches of more improved agricultural landscapes, such areas, sometimes preserved as common-lands, as on Gower and in Pembrokeshire (Meade 1981), can include most of the transitions of this kind. In these localities, the wet heath can be represented by the Ericetum tetralicis, with the Succisa-Carex community of which the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture has much in common, and this can grade in waterlogged hollows to the Narthecio-Sphagnetum valley bog with Hyperico-Potametum soakways. Again, Mo/zwzYz-domi-nated vegetation can supervene in such transitions where gentle slopes have some modest flushing or where burning and grazing have favoured its spread. In the south-west of Britain and south Wales, this may be far-flung stands of the Cirsio-Molinietum where there is some base-enrichment in the ground waters but, usually, it is some kind of Molinia-Potentilla mire. Where this adjoins the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture, transitions between the two can be very gentle or form complex mosaics of dominance by rushes and Molinia (e.g. Meade 1981, Ratcliffe & Hattey 1982: site type V). Topogenous hollows in the lowlands can also show https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.027 Published online by Cambridge University PressM23 Juncus effusus /acutiflorus-Galium palustre rush-pasture 251 zonations from the community to vegetation on peat, where the latter accumulates under the influence of a more or less permanently high water-table. In such situations, the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture can form a fringe around Phragmitetalia fen, into which the Junci can extend some way, but where continuity is seen mainly through tall dicotyledons like Cirsium palustre, Angelica sylvestris and Filipendula ulmaria, and other herbs such as Galium palustre, Ranunculus flammula, Mentha aquatica, Cardamine pratensis, Hydrocotyle vul garis and Epilobium palustre, with a switch in dominance to helophytes, notably Phragmites australis or, quite commonly around open-water transitions in the western parts of Britain, Carex rostrata. Reed-dominated vegetation is often of the Phragmites-Eupatorium fen, the outward spread of Phragmites often being curtailed by grazing ahead of its edaphic limit (site types VII & VIII, Ratcliffe & Hattey 1982); while an increase in C. ros trata, together with Potentilla palustris, Menyanthes trifoliata and Equisetum fluviatile, all of them occasional in the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture, usually marks a transition to the Potentillo-Caricetum (site type IV, Ratcliffe & Hattey 1982). Where stock, usually cattle in these situations, come down to water at such fen stands within enclosed pastures, the Juncus-Galium fringe is typically a much-puddled zone. Transitions from the community to Phragmites-Eupatorium fen can also be seen on the unimproved margins of sluggish streams and rivers, where the Jun cus-Galium rush-pasture can persist on alluvial gleys over the terraces. Here, too, the Filipendula-Angelica tail-herb fen is often to be found on soils which are too dry to support dense Phragmites but periodically enriched by allochthonous mineral matter deposited in floods. Grazing, again, may have some influence on the transition from the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture to this Filipendulion community. Fragments of these kinds of zonations can often be seen alongside field-margin ditches and along damp hedge-banks. In all these situations, it is usually grazing, much less often mowing, which maintains the Juncus-Cirsium rush-pasture; and imprudent pasturing, with its fre quent poaching, probably enhances the hold of the community on these ill-draining soils. Where grazing is withheld, however, and there is no cutting or burning of the vegetation, serai progression can be rapid with direct invasion of woody plants, particularly of Salix cinerea and Betula pubescens, whose light fruits can be wind-borne for considerable distances, and sometimes also of Alnus, if seed-parents are close. Where a persistent phase of Filipendula-or Mö/zma-dominance does not supervene, such colonists can quickly come to prevail in stands of Salix-Galium woodland, a particularly widespread and common community of gleyed mineral soils in the western lowlands of Britain, or of Betula-Molinia woodland. With these two vegetation types, the Juncus-Galium fen-meadow can show considerable floristic overlap, sometimes surviving little changed under more open canopies. It is possible that at lower altitudes such woodlands eventually progress further by the invasion of Quercus robur. Distribution "
"m24","Zonation and succession The Cirsio-Molinietum is typically found as part of transitions between tail-herb fens or other kinds of mire vegetation on the one hand and grasslands or dry heaths on the other. Essentially, such sequences reflect variations in the soil water-regime but the particular com munities involved differ according to the base-status of the mire waters and their surrounding soils and with the regional climate. And the proportions of the different vegetation types within the zonations are very much influenced by the degree to which treatments have modified the natural patterns. Land improvement has increasingly modified the drier portions of the zonations and often destroyed the community altogether by extending drainage and reclamation right on to areas of mire. In other cases, stands remain intact but have become fragmented and isolated within intensive agri cultural landscapes. Even where larger tracts have sur vived longer, the abandonment of traditional treatments has often left them to revert to rank secondary fen and scrubby woodland. Within central and eastern England, where the usual context for the community is the surrounds of calcareous mire systems, extensive zonations are now scarce. However, it is still possible to see, at various localities in the flood-plain mires of Broadland (Wheeler 1978, 1980c) and the Fens (Godwin 1978) and along the margins of chalkland rivers in East Anglia (Haslam 1965) and elsewhere (Wheeler 1975, Ratcliffe 1977), transitions from the Typical or Eupatorium sub-communities to Phragmitetalia fen. Around the Norfolk Broads, the latter is usually some form of Peucedano-Phragmitetum, elsewhere generally the Phragmites-Eupatorium fen, and the extent and clarity of the junctions between such vegetation types and the Cirsio-Molinietum depend in large measure on how treatments have been imposed and withdrawn over the sequence of progressively drier soils through the mire. In some places, the boundaries between old mowing-marsh com partments can still be marked by fairly abrupt switches from what was fen-meadow mown for litter to tail-herb fen cut for reed or sedge. In parts of Wicken and in other reserves where mowing is used as part of the management of the vegetation, such transitions remain crisp and provide not only a glimpse of the once-widespread patchwork of secondary fen, but also an active indication of how one community can be transformed into another. Often, however, such patterns are now blurred by long neglect, with Phragmites re-establishing itself through the Cirsio-Molinietum and apparently capricious mixtures of fen and fen-meadow plants occurring in rank jumbles, frequently invaded by scrub. Commonly, then, transitions from the Cirsio-Molinietum to Phragmitetalia vegetation have to be seen in the much more compressed sequences found in ill-drained field corners and along marginal ditches, where it is grazing that usually mediates the transition. Another, still fairly widespread, though increasingly local, zonation to be seen in this part of Britain occurs around the soligenous fen vegetation associated with springs and seepage lines fed by calcareous waters. In such situations, the Typical sub-community often forms a marginal zone around the Schoenetum which occupies the central area where base-richness and through-put https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.028 Published online by Cambridge University Press264 Mires are at a maximum. Grazing often occurs throughout such zonations and floristic continuity is therefore maintained through resistant small herbs whose edaphic tolerances are fairly broad. What marks the switch in vegetation types is the increasing representation of calcicoles in moving to the heart of the spring-fen, both among the vascular plants and in the bryophytes which are often well represented in the rather open areas of sward between the dominants, and the switch from a preponderance of Molinia to Schoenus. Withdrawal of grazing in such vegetation results in the development of the ranker and impoverished Festuca-Juncus sub community of the Schoenetum, which is very close in its composition to the Typical Cirsio-Molinietum and perhaps represents a successional extension of the latter into more calcareous situations with neglect. Both these types of zonations can be complicated by the occurrence of the other kind of lowland southern fen-meadow, the Juncus-Cirsium community alongside the Cirsio-Molinietum. As explained above, a combination of edaphic and treatment factors may differentiate these vegetation types, the latter apparently favouring drier ground than the former, though perhaps also being derived from it where mowing or grazing have been applied over long periods of time. Whatever the particular environmental influences on each, the com munities are certainly very close and sometimes have to be distinguished simply by the proportions of their usual dominants, J. subnodulosus and Molinia. Fen helo phytes, large sedges and dicotyledons can also occur in the Juncus-Cirsium fen-meadow, so very complex patchworks of dominance, superimposed over lower tiers of herbage which share many species in common, have to be expected in such situations: they are a reflection of floristic convergence where agricultural activities have been brought to bear around the more accessible fringes of these mire systems. Under traditional treatments, and particularly graz ing, there was often a strong measure of continuity between such fen-meadows and the vegetation of the drier ground beyond the influence of a fluctuating watertable in topogenous mires or above springs and seepage lines. This is less so now that agricultural improvement has pressed very closely around ill-drained remnants of the landscape, but in some localities good uninterrupted zonations can still be seen. In eastern England, for example, topogenous hollows in drift or springs in the Chalk sometimes pass above to rendzina soils developed from the bedrock, when the Typical sub-community can grade to some sort of Mesobromion sward, usually in this part of Britain, the Festuca-Avenula grassland or, towards central England, its derivatives dominated by Bromus erectus or Brachypodium pinnatum. Species such as Briza media, Agrostis stolonifera, Festuca rubra and some mesophytic dicotyledons like Prunella vulgaris, Ranunculus acris and Plantago lanceolata, run on into the calcicolous sward and there may be some transgression of herbs in the opposite direction, but generally speaking the boundary is quite a sharp one. Over less pervious and calcareous bedrocks, but where there has still not been very much improvement of the surrounding grassland, the Typical Cirsio-Molinietum can pass to the Centaureo-Cynosuretum, with which it is linked through plants like Holcus lanatus, Centaurea nigra, Festuca rubra, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Briza media, Potentilla erecta and Succisa pratensis. And, then, where artificial fertilisers have been applied to such swards and the land drained and perhaps top-sown or ploughed and re-seeded, a Cynosurion sward like the Lolio-Cynosureturn may surround what are simply fragments of the Cirsio-Molinietum which have not yet succumbed to improvement. Outside major areas of calcareous mire vegetation like Broadland, it is often these drier ends of transitions in which the community can be found, marking out remnant topogenous hollows within tracts of pasture. Towards south-western Britain, these latter kinds of zonations also occur but here there is a shift in the constituent vegetation types towards the more calcifuge. Thus, it is the Juncus-Erica sub-community that is the usual type of Cirsio-Molinietum that is found in moderately base-rich damper hollows in pastures around the upland fringes, and this can grade on the drier grazed surround to acidophilous sub-communities of the Lolio-Cynosuretum or Centaurea-Cynosuretum or to mesophytic types of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland (NCC Devon Heathland Report 1980), according to the degree of improvement. More distinctive, however, is the widespread occurrence of the Juncus-Erica sub-community within heathland complexes in south-west Britain, most notably on the common lands of the Devon Pebble Beds, on the Culm in the north-west of that county and more locally on Gower. Here, in the kind of sequence well seen in the study of Aylesbeare Common by Ivimey-Cook et al. (1975), the Cirsio-Molinietum occupies sloping ground around tracts of the Ericetum tetralicis, to which it may grade through the Succisa-Carex sub-community of the wet heath, and, more locally, of the Schoenus-Narthecium mire, both of which in turn can pass over permanently waterlogged ground to the Narthecio-Sphagnetum. On drier ground, the Juncus-Erica sub-community often grades to some kind of Ulex gallii-Agrostis heath, into which Molinia runs but where E. tetralix, Calluna and U. gallii increase their cover to become major elements of the vegetation, and from which Molinietalia herbs are mostly excluded. In such zonations, expansion of the cover of Molinia can make the patterns very difficult to interpret because this tends to swamp the representation of any associates https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.028 Published online by Cambridge University PressM24 Cirsio-Molinietum caeruleae fen-meadow 265 which might give some clue as to the original character of the vegetation. Burning followed by heavy grazing is especially likely to favour the spread of Molinia on the moister ground in these sequences, and it is quite common for the Cirsio-Molinietum to occur with more impoverished vegetation with Molinia, J. acutiflorus, Potentilla erecta and perhaps occasional Cirsium palustre and Angelica, which would probably be grouped within the Molinia-Potentilla mire. This is largely a western and northern equivalent to the Cirsio-Molinietum but the ranges of the two vegetation types overlap around the upland fringes of the south-west and, in this area of transitional climate, treatments are perhaps quite readily able to convert the one into the other. In the absence of any kind of treatment, all stands of the community are probably able in theory to progress to scrub or woodland, although reversion to tail-herb fen around topogenous mires or the development of a very dense Molinia conqx may greatly hinder invasion of woody plants. The ultimate character of any woodland vegetation probably also differs according to the eda-phic conditions. In the flood-plain mires of central and eastern England, the natural successor to Phragmitetalia fen is the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland and it is possible that abandoned fen-meadow may revert to the final stages of this serai line, developing into the Alnus-Filipendula sub-community, where the influence of the base-rich ground waters is not too remote. However, long-continued mowing or grazing on somewhat drier ground may be accompanied by the surface-leaching and nutrient-depletion that favour the ultimate establishment of the Betula-Molinia woodland over neglected fen-meadow: the Juncus sub-community of that forest type can show considerable floristic similarity to the Typical Cirsio-Molinietum and birch invasion may effect a ready conversion of the one to the other. To the south-west, too, Betula pubescens is the most likely coloniser of ungrazed heaths among which the Juncus-Erica sub-community occurs, and there perhaps the Juncus or Sphagnum sub-communities of the woodland may succeed the fen-meadow. Stands of the Cirsio-Molinietum around more base-rich soligenous mires, very local to the west but widespread further east, could perhaps develop into Alno-Ulmion forest, though the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland is essentially an oceanic community rare in the drier parts of Britain. Distribution "
"m25","Zonation and succession The Molinia-Potentilla mire is a common and widespread element in the heath and moorland scenery of western Britain, occurring with other mire communities, heaths and grasslands in zonations and mosaics under the primary influence of edaphic conditions, though much affected by treatments. At lower altitudes, improvement has often grossly altered or truncated such sequences, leaving them isolated within intensive agri cultural landscapes. On somewhat higher ground, afforestation has often been centred on slopes previously occupied by the community, though many tracts remain in more intact zonations and have extended their cover on to much-burned and grazed ground. Such treatments play an important part in preventing serai progression to scrub woodland. The simplest patterns are to be seen where the Molinia-Potentilla mire marks out tracts of moist but well-aerated ground within sequences from grassland or dry heath to bog over ground which becomes increasingly ill-drained and eventually permanently waterlogged. In the less humid parts of its range, in south Wales and through south-west England, where such zonations are strongly dependent on topography, it is thus commonly found on the slopes around valley bogs, its exact position in the sequence of vegetation types depending on the conformation of the ground and the way in which seepage is affected by the permeability of the underlying deposits. Generally speaking, it occurs in such zonations at or around the level of the wet heath, interposed between the drier heaths on the podzols of the interfluves and the bog vegetation of the waterlogged peats in the valley bottoms. Where the ground drops away fairly quickly from among the former, gathering substantial amounts of seepage and channelling it down the slope, then there can be a direct switch to the Molinia-Potentilla mire over the flushed zones. In south-west Britain, Molinia finds strong representation among communities like the Ulex minor-Agrostis and Ulex gallii-Agrostis heaths, but transitions from these vegetation types are usually fairly well marked in a decisive shift in dominance to the grass, with a much reduced cover of sub shrubs. Quite often, however, where there are extensive tracts of flatter and ill-drained ground around the drier heaths, the Ericetum tetralicis wet heath supervenes between them and the Molinia-Potentilla mire, and then boundaries can be much less well defined, particularly if there is some extension of the soligenous influence back into the wet heath. Then, the Angelica sub-community of the Molinia-Potentilla mire can grade imperceptibly to the Succisa-Carex sub-community of the Ericetum, taller herbs, clumps of rushes and an over-canopy of Myrica sometimes providing a strong visual continuity throughout and masking the gradual move in dominance from the grass to a more mixed cover of Molinia and ericoids. Downslope, where the levelling of the ground in such terrain leads to permanent waterlogging and the accumulation of deeper acid peats, the Molinia-Potentilla mire is typically replaced by the Narthecio-Sphagnetum valley bog. To such vegetation, the Erica sub community can form a gradual transition and Molinia itself persists with high frequency into the bog, but it becomes non-tussocky and grows ever more weakly in the stagnant conditions and the Sphagnum cover, dotted with abundant Narthecium and Drosera rotundifolia, extends to form a luxuriant carpet. In many larger valley mires of this kind, there is also a longitudinal zonation between these two communities, the Narthecio-Sphagnetum being concentrated towards the stagnant head of the valley and giving way downstream, with increasing channelling of the waters, to the Molinia-Potentilla mire, though sometimes persisting over a marginal zone of stagnation between it and the surrounding Ericetum tetralicis. Further complexities arise in such patterns where there is some variation in the base-richness of the seepage waters because of geological heterogeneity. A slight rise in pH within such flushed ground in southwest Britain is generally marked by the occurrence of the Cirsio-Molinietum which, in its distinctive Juncus-Erica sub-community, comes very close in its composition to the Molinia-Potentilla mire and which can occur adjacent to it or replace it in neighbouring, but more base rich, seepage zones. Schoenus can figure patchily in such situations and sometimes thickens its cover in strongly irrigated mires as the dominant in the distinctive Schoenus-Narthecium community or, where the waters are more base-rich, in vegetation resembling the Schoenetum though usually without J. subnodulosus. Sequences of this kind, occasionally complete, often in part and sometimes disposed in complex mosaics over gently undulating terrain with complex hydrology, are a very characteristic feature of the heathlands of southwest Britain. The Molinia-Potentilla mire can be seen, represented to a greater or lesser degree, where such patterns have developed over the Eocene clays, sands and gravels of the New Forest and Dorset (Ratcliffe 1977), the Triassic deposits of the Devon Pebble-Bed Commons (well shown in Ivimey-Cook et al. 1975), the Carboniferous rocks of north-west Devon (NCC Devon Heathland Report 1980) and Gower, and on Silurian and Ordovician rocks, variously smeared with drift, https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.029 Published online by Cambridge University PressM25 Molinia caerulea-Potentilla erecta mire 277 through west Wales (Meade 1981). And analogous, though rather striking, zonations are to be found over the serpentine and gabbro of the Lizard (Hopkins 1983), where the community occurs among dry and wet heaths in both of which Erica vagans figures prominently. Northwards in this western part of Britain, the basic pattern of vegetation types in such sequences is pre served but, with the increasing rainfall, there is an extension of the wetter components of the zonation out of the narrow topographic confines characteristic of the south-west, and a switch to the sub-montane analogues of many of the communities. Even on Gower, much of the wet heath begins to resemble the Scirpus-Erica community, which replaces the Ericetum tetralicis in north-west Britain and which mantles many of the thinner peat soils through the upland fringes, forming an intergrade between a variety of sub-montane heaths and grasslands on podzolic profiles to blanket bog, usually the Scirpus-Er iophorum mire, on deep ombroge-nous peats. Typically, in this kind of landscape, the Molinia-Potentilla mire marks out water-tracks running through this zonation, channelling seepage from the bog or wet heath and carrying it downslope through the drier heaths and grasslands, or gathering it from shedding slopes above the bog and debouching it on to its surface (e.g. McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Edgell 1969). Again, though Molinia occurs frequently in the bog and wet heath vegetation in such zonations, its abundance usually increases very markedly over the soligenous zones, so the boundary of the community is often clear. However, as before, where seepage extends back into the wet heath, transitions can be less well defined, with the Molinia-Potentilla mire grading to the Carex sub community of the Scirpus-Erica wet heath: as in southern valley bogs, Myrica can form a canopy over both these vegetation types. And, there can be analogous complications along the length of seepage tracts, with the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire and the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture replacing the Molinia-Potentilla mire according to the base-poverty of the soils and flushing waters and the extent of waterlogging as the ground levels and falls away over the hillsides. Similar kinds of vegetation, though disposed in rather different fashion, can be seen where the Molinia-Potentilla mire occurs on raised bogs in western Britain. Here, it again marks out the better-drained tracts of the mire surface, typically dominating the rand which surrounds the active plane, itself generally carrying some form of the Erica-Sphagnum papillosum mire, sometimes fringed by a zone of Scirpus-Erica wet heath, a pattern seen in classic form at Cors Goch glan Teifi (Godwin & Conway 1939) and on a smaller scale at Malham (Proctor 1974, Adam et al. 1975). Where well-aerated conditions are maintained in the marginal lagg of such bogs, the Molinia-Potentilla mire can extend its cover into this, but more consistent waterlogging there is often marked by the occurrence of some kind of Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire or rush-pasture. Patterns of this kind are often further complicated by treatments, particularly by burning and grazing, which have been a traditional element in the management of both the lowland heath and the upland fringes in which this community is found. Practised with care, these treatments, either alone or in concert, do little damage to the Molinia-Potentilla mire: indeed, they probably often ultimately prevent serai progression and, on moister soils, can reinforce the uncompromising dominance of Molinia by helping eliminate its associates or competitors. And it is this latter effect that is seen most fre quently in the kinds of zonations discussed above because, where the surrounding wet heaths are subject to burning and then grazed, they show a strong tendency to develop into the Molinia-Potentilla mire, extending its cover outside what would be its normal edaphic bounds. Such a succession can extend on to the deeper peats of the bog themselves and is especially likely where artificial drainage has sharpened up the loss of water from the mire plane. This was already visible at Cors Goch glan Teifi at the time of Godwin & Conway's (1939) study, markedly enhancing what was perhaps a natural tendency with the drying climate, and it is now very evident on, for example, the raised and blanket mires surveyed through Strathclyde by Bignal & Curtis (1981). It can be seen, too, where longitudinal drains have been put through some of the valley mires in the New Forest. Over drier ground, where the Molinia tends to be not quite so abundant and not so strongly hummocky, grazing can perhaps effect more obvious changes in the community itself. The Anthoxanthum sub-community, for example, characteristic of grazed sites, has much in common with moist Nardo-Galion swards and continued pasturing could perhaps effect a transition to that kind of grassland and, combined with draining and the application of fertiliser, convert the Molinia-Potentilla mire into a Cynosurion sward. However, where there is a tendency towards poaching of the ground here, particularly likely where moist mineral soils are heavily grazed with cattle, there is a strong likelihood of rushes spreading with the eventual development of the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture. Mosaics of these two vegetation types are very common on some of the heavily-grazed Gower commons on soils derived from Carboniferous shales. The common occurrence of scattered shrubs and trees in association with the Molinia-Potentilla mire, particularly on lowland commons where seed-parents are often close at hand, suggests that, where treatments are relaxed and where the herbage has not grown too rank, https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.029 Published online by Cambridge University Press278 Mires succession to scrub and woodland could be quite rapid. Salix cinerea and Betula pubescens are the commonest woody species found in such situations though, further north, S. aurita becomes more frequent (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Prentice & Prentice 1975). The likely development in such seres would be the Betula-Molinia woodland, in the more open flushed stands of which many of the characteristic herbs here survive. The potential suitability for forestry of the soils under the Molinia-Potentilla mire, often better-drained and somewhat richer than the surrounding ground, means that tracts of the community have often been replaced, in whole or part, by coniferous plantations. This is particularly widespread in the upland fringes of the north-west where such forests have been established, often with little care for the natural configuration of the ground, cutting across sequences of wet heath and mire, but it can also be seen on certain lowland heaths, notably over some New Forest zonations. Elsewhere in the lowlands, other tracts of the community, together with neighbouring vegetation, have been lost to agricultural improvement or left as isolated fragments in intensively pastoral landscapes. Distribution "
"m26","Zonation and succession The Molinia-Crepis mire can be found in zonations and mosaics with other kinds of fen vegetation, with grasslands and woodland, disposed according to variations in the height of the water-table, in the base-richness, calcium content and nutrient status of the waters and soils, and in the pattern of treatment. Around open waters, it may be a natural part of primary hydrarch successions with some stability but, on drier ground, grazing probably plays some part in its maintenance. Pastoral mismanagement or land improvement can both destroy this vegetation, and have probably contributed to its present very local distribution. The simplest kind of sequence in which the community can be seen relates to differences in the water-regime of underlying soils. At both Sunbiggin (Holdgate 195 5b) and Malham (Proctor 1974), for example, the Molinia-Crepis mire can be seen in complex mosaics, but part of the floristic variation is controlled by the degree of waterlogging in the peats. On wetter ground in these sites, the Sanguisorba sub-community, already with a https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.030 Published online by Cambridge University PressM26 Molinia caerulea-Crepis paludosa mire 287 modest representation of Phragmitetalia plants, grades to tail-herb fen, typically in these northern basins, of the Potentillo-Caricetum rostratae. There, dominance switches to large sedges, notably C. rostrata but sometimes also C. appropinquata or a tussocky form of C. nigra, occasionally with some rushes or an overtopping canopy of Phragmites. Molinia extends hardly at all into this vegetation and the most common associates are plants like Potentilla palustris, Menyanthes trifoliata and Equisetum fluviatile, but some continuity is maintained through such associates as Angelica sylvestris, Cirsium palustre, Caltha palustris and Galium palustre. In such situations as these, however, where the mire waters are draining from catchments in which calcareous rocks predominate, here Carboniferous Limestone, wetter soils are also often more base-rich and more oligotrophic so that Caricion davallianae vege tation is a characteristic element of the sequences, sometimes replacing the Phragmitetalia fen, or occurring alongside it, where there are fine-scale variations in the quality of the incoming waters. Typically, in sites like Sunbiggin and Malham, and particularly on rather sloppy peats, the community is the Carex-Calliergon mire, many of whose plants are shared with the Potentillo-Caricetum, but which has a less prominent mesophytic element and a stronger contingent of calcicoles. Continuity with the Molinia-Crepis mire can thus be quite substantial, through plants tolerant of the middle range of pH and nutrient status, such as Molinia itself, Carex panicea, C. nigra, Succisa, Angelica, Cirsium palustre, Valeriana dioica, Caltha, Equisetum palustre and Filipendula. But with the move on to more base-rich and wetter soils, dominance passes to such sedges as Carex diandra with C. lepidocarpa, C. demissa and C. dioica appearing among the associates, and the patchy bryophyte cover of the Molinia-Crepis mire is replaced by lush carpets of larger Calliergon spp., with Campy-lium stellatum, Scorpidium scorpioides, Drepanocladus revolvens and Bryum pseudotriquetrum. On firmer, but still very wet and base-rich, peat and peaty mineral soils, the Molinia-Crepis mire grades to a different kind of Caricion davallianae fen. In mires like those at Sunbiggin and Malham, such situations are usually found around the margins, where there is flushing from the surrounding slopes through a stagnohumic gley and down on to the fen peat itself and then the Sanguisorba sub-community may extend up from the mire surface to form the flush surrounds. Over more open slopes, such a marginal position around this kind of Caricion davallianae flush is very much the characteristic location of the Festuca sub-community. Almost always, the Caricion community is the Pinguiculo-Cari-cetum dioicae, a small-sedge fen which, like flush stands of the Molinia-Crepis mire, is often kept short by grazing. Structural and floristic similarities between these vegetation types are thus often very considerable: tall herbs are rarely a feature of the Pinguiculo-Carice-tum, but such plants as Molinia, C. panicea, C. nigra, Succisa, Potentilla erecta, Equisetum palustre, Prunella vulgaris, together with Juncus articulatus and the grasses Briza media, Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum, occur commonly in both communities. The calcicole con tingent in the Pinguiculo-Caricetum is, however, generally more striking than in the Carex-Calliergon mire, so close inspection will usually reveal that transitions from the Molinia-Crepis mire are marked by a general switch to dominance by mixtures of C. panicea with C. dioica, C. lepidocarpa, C. hostiana, C.flacca and C. pulicaris, a variety of smaller herbs such as Pinguicula vulgaris, Selaginella selaginoides, Linum catharticum, Parnassia palustris, and extensive patches of bryophytes like Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Drepanocladus revolvens, Campylium stellatum, Aneura pinguis and Ctenidium molluscum. In the opposite direction in such sequences as these, increasing dryness of the ground is often marked by a shift from the Molinia-Crepis mire to some kind of Nardo-Galion sward over gently-flushed brown soils developed from the drift cover that typically plasters the surrounding slopes. Through the north Pennines, such vegetation is usually the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, into which grasses like Festuca rubra, F. ovina, Anthoxanthum and Briza, together with Carex panicea, Potentilla erecta, Ranunculus acris and Prunella vulgaris, run on with high frequency. Where the drift cover is thinner and the sward more strongly influenced by the free-draining calcareous bedrock, this is replaced by the Sesleria-Galium grassland, with a more marked calcicolous element. Quite often, transitions of these kinds are further complicated by greater natural variations in the trophic state of the soils. This is clearly seen around the margins of fen complexes like those at Malham where incoming streams winding through the Molinia-Crepis mire slacken their flow and drop quantities of rich silt, but it sometimes occurs, too, at the foot of slopes where flushing waters debouch on to the flatter ground below. Then, along the levees or deltas of the deeper mineral material, the community can grade to the Filipendula-Angelica mire in which mixtures of tall mesophytic dicotyledons predominate. Such complexities as these and the way in which even simple transitions can be fragmented into mosaics with variations in water-table and base-status over mire surfaces, can obscure the fact that the Molinia-Crepis community may play a part in primary successions around open waters. At Malham, for example, stratigraphy reveals that this kind of vegetation can succeed more calcicolous fen with progressive terrestrialisation (Proctor 1974). Subsequent stages in succession have https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.030 Published online by Cambridge University Press288 Mires not been followed, though where the herbage does not become too rank, it is likely that woody plants, notably Salix spp. and Betula pubescens, could develop fairly quickly into a scrubby canopy. Towards the limit of the spread of the Molinia-Crepis mire on to wetter sub strates, such a cover would probably be of the Salix-Carex rostrata type, the usual woodland of wetter basin peats in northern Britain, where mesotrophic and moderately base-rich conditions prevail. Over drier ground, which might develop eventually within tracts of the above woodland from ombrotrophic nuclei, the Betula-Molinia woodland might succeed this. This vege tation type and, over somewhat more base-rich ground, the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland, can also be found over slope flushes around the Pennine fringes, where otherwise the Molinia-Crepis mire might be expected, and these too may represent natural successors to it, showing considerable floristic similarities. In drier situations, grazing undoubtedly plays some part in arresting these serai progressions and some stands may represent the more or less direct result of past woodland clearance and pasturing. In this respect, the presence of plants like Anemone nemorosa and Ranunculus auricomus in the community is interesting, and the general similarity to the Anthoxanthum-Gera-nium grassland, essentially a mown derivative of the flush woodlands mentioned above, noteworthy. Under moderate and judicious grazing, the Molinia-Crepis mire is probably stable but careless sward management or improvement can produce marked changes. With heavy grazing over impeded soils, there is a strong tendency for rushes to become abundant and dunging may help effect a shift towards the Juncus-Galium rushpasture, the widespread Juncion acutiflori vegetation of mesotrophic gleyed soils in north-west Britain. In drier situations, and particularly where there has been some enrichment with manure or chemical fertilisers, the sward may begin to approach a mesotrophic Nardo-Galion grassland or a Cynosurion community and top sowing or ploughing and re-seeding can fully effect such a transformation over less intractable ground. In some places, rougher terrain has given the Molinia-Crepis mire enough protection to ensure its isolated survival but destruction with agricultural improvement has pro bably been widespread. Distribution "
"m27","Zonation and succession The community can be found in a wide variety of zonations and mosaics with swamps, other kinds of mire, tail-herb vegetation and grasslands, among which the major lines of floristic variation are governed by interactions between soil moisture and trophic state and by differences in treatment. Scrub and woodland also often occur in close association with the Filipendula-Angelica mire and can undoubtedly develop from it, though, in many cases, this kind of vegetation seems somewhat resistant to the invasion of woody plants and able to persist in a fairly stable state, provided edaphic conditions and treatment remain unchanged. In the more natural vegetation sequences in which the Filipendula-Angelica mire is to be seen, it typically occupies a zone between standing or sluggish open waters on the one hand, and tail-herb communities on the other. Alongside small streams, as seen at Black Beck in the Esthwaite fens (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939) and at Malham (Proctor 1974), it can actually run right down to the water's edge, forming a strip over the intermittently flooded ground and often helping to accumulate small levees. In other cases, it can give way below to emergent vegetation on the permanently sub merged ground or that subject to extensive winter flooding. To the north of Britain, where the Valeriana-Rumex sub-community is a common component of open-water transitions around lakes and along streams, it is the Caricetum rostratae which often replaces it on wetter ground or, more locally, the Caricetum vesicariae, and, with these vegetation types, there can be a measure of floristic continuity, some of the associates of the Filipendula-Angelica mire extending out under the dominant sedge (Spence 1964, Proctor 1974, Adam et al. 1975). Such swamps also extend into western Britain and can be found abutting on to the Juncus-Holcus sub community where this occurs around open waters. To the south and east, by contrast, where the Urtica-Vicia sub-community is typical, it is the Phragmitetum australis that most often replaces it on wetter ground or, more occasionally, the Caricetum paniculatae or communities like the Sparganietum erecti or Typhetum latifoliae\ and, again, there can be some gradations between the vege tation types. Along stream sides and drainage ditches and around small pools and ponds which are maintained in an open condition, particularly common habitats for the Filipendula-Angelica mire to the south of Britain, zonations such as these can be very compressed, with little more than fragments of the various communities occurring in https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.031 Published online by Cambridge University Press296 Mires a belt of very small overall width. In more extensive open-water transitions, on the other hand, such as those found around some lakes in northern Britain and in Broadland, the ground between the swamps and the Filipendula-Angelica mire can be occupied by a wide zone of what is essentially Phragmitetalia fen, in which the tall helophytes and bulky sedges of the swamps retain their dominance but are accompanied by a richer suite of associates which shows considerable continuity with the meadowsweet vegetation. To the north of the country, such fen is typically of the Potentillo-Caricetum rostratae type; to the south and east, it can generally be grouped in the Phragmites-Eupatorium fen or, in Broadland the Peucedano-Phragmitetum, or very often now, around disturbed and eutrophicated water-margins, the Phragmites-Urtica fen. However, only where the substrates of the fen hinterland are maintained in a reasonably rich state, either by fresh deposition of silt in floods, or by input of nutrients from the landward edge, will they be able to sustain the Filipendula-Angelica mire in such extended zonations as these and, at some sites with large tracts of fen, the community is very much restricted to the edges of streams, soakways or dykes, running through, or cut through, the flood-plain deposits. Both kinds of pattern can be seen at Malham, where complex variations in water-depth and nutrient-and base-status across the fens result in particularly varied mosaics of rich and poor fens disposed over the peats between the channels and grading, with varying degrees of abruptness, to the Filipendula-Angelica mire on the richer, circumneutral deposits (Proctor 1974). Even in more extensive and natural zonations such as these, the sequence of vegetation types rarely continues on to drier ground without some suspicion of modification as a result of man's activities. Very locally in northern Britain, it is possible to see transitions from the Valeriana-Rumex sub-community to the Molinia-Crepis mire on ground that is subject to less marked fluctuations in water level, as at Malham (Proctor 1974), and, around flushes on the lower valley sides of some Pennine dales, such zonations can continue into stretches of Anthoxanthum-Geranium grassland, a community which is often cut for hay, but which is otherwise little improved (Jones 1984). Very commonly through northern and western Britain, however, even where the sur rounds of mires and flushes with the Filipendula-Angelica mire have escaped marked improvement, they are heavily grazed, so many stands of the Valeriana-Rumex and Juncus-Holcus sub-communities survive sharply marked off from surrounding Nardo-Galion swards by artificial boundaries, remaining largely within fenced-off damp hollows or field corners, and persisting otherwise only in very fragmentary fashion along stream sides running through pasture.The situation within southern and eastern England is very similar, except that there the agricultural landscape is more intensive and largely given over in certain areas to arable cropping with its attendant eutrophication of the drainage waters by fertiliser run-off. More natural zonations probably run from the Urtica-Vicia sub community to some kind of Arrhenatheretum, and there can be considerable overlap between the two vegetation types. Paradoxically, such transitions are now most easily seen within the artificial roadside verge habitat, where damp ditches and drier banks often carry these two closely juxtaposed. In many places, however, the Urtica-Vicia sub-community gives way, not to such grasslands, but to eutrophic tail-herb vegetation dominated by such plants as Urtica and Epilobium hirsutum, which forms a fringe on the disturbed and enriched edges of mires and drainage ditches, set within intensive pastoral or arable landscapes. Where more traditional regimes of mowing and graz ing have been extended down, around mires and flushes, on to the moister soils normally occupied by the Filipen dula-Angelica mire, further variations on these patterns can be seen. Detailed studies of the effects of such treatments on the community have never been undertaken, but it seems likely that grazing, and perhaps also regular summer-mowing, convert it to the kinds of vegetation, generally dominated by rushes, included in the Calthion to the east of Britain, and in the Juncion acutiflori to the west and north. Where the Urtica-Vicia sub-community occurs in spring-fens, for example, it can often be seen alongside the Juncus-Cirsium rushpasture in those areas where stock have access or which, in the past, were mown for litter. Similarly, to the west, a very common context for the Juncus-Holcus sub-community is stretches of the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture, which form a transitional zone between the Filipendula-Angelica mire and the surrounding Nardo-Galion sward where stock have had access to the damper flush sur rounds. With further cropping and selective nutrient de pletion, such developments could proceed further with the expansion of Molinia in Junco-Molinion swards. Even where such treatments have been withheld for long periods of time, progression of the Filipendula-Angelica mire to woodland seems slow, perhaps because of the overwhelming dominance of the meadowsweet, and, quite commonly, stands of the community can be found closely hemmed in by a cover of trees or shrubs. However, observation suggests that invasion of woody plants can take place and it seems likely to result in the development of either drier forms of the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland, particularly in the south and east, or, to the west and north, the Salix-Galium or Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodlands. Drying and dis turbance of the substrate probably favours progression to the Alnus-Urtica woodland. https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.031 Published online by Cambridge University PressM27 Filipendula ulmaria-Angelica sylvestris mire 297 Distribution "
"m28","Zonation and succession The Filipendulo-Iridetum can be found around springs and flushes close to the coast in zonations which largely reflect variation in soil moisture, acidity and trophic state and differences in treatment on the surrounding ground, but the most striking vegetation patterns are to be seen where the community occurs on the upper part of the sea-shore where it can pass to salt-marsh and shingle communities with an increase in maritime influence. In such habitats particularly, the Filipendulo-Iridetum appears to be a fairly natural vegetation type and one which develops but slowly to woodland. In situations set back a little from the coast, the community can be found in very much the same kind of zonations as the Filipendula-Angelica mire, especially its Juncus-Holcus sub-community. In the more oceanic parts of the country, the Juncus sub-community of the Filipendulo-Iridetum replaces that vegetation type, occupying gleyed mesotrophic soils in flushes and hollows over gently-sloping ground near the coast. Usually, the landscape context in this kind of situation is one of marginal pastoral agriculture, with the community sur rounded by relatively unimproved, grazed swards of the Nardo-Galion, like the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grass land, or of the Junco-Molinion, like the Molinia-Potentilla mire, or, where there is a sharper transition to damp, nutrient-poor peat, by the Scirpus-Erica wet heath. Where grazing stock penetrate some way on to the wetter, mesotrophic soils around the flushes, a zone of the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture may be interposed between the Filipendulo-Iridetum and the drier grasslands around, Molinietalia herbs such as Filipendula ulmaria, Angelica and Cirsium palustre running out far into the rush-dominated vegetation together with ranker grasses like Holcus and Festuca rubra. Where the land has been improved a little by fertiliser application and re-seeding, then the whole sequence of vegetation types can be shifted somewhat, with the Filipendulo-Iridetum passing to the Holco-Juncetum and thence to Lolio-Cynosuretum. Such patterns can be seen on Anglesey and have been described from Mull and Iona (Gillham 1957Z?) and from Arran (Adam et al. 1977). Over the distinctive machair topography that has developed over the raised beaches in the latter sites and elsewhere in western Scotland, a local variation on these kinds of zonations can be seen where the influence of the consolidated shell-sand overlying much of the ground becomes paramount: then the Festuca-Galium dune grassland can become prominent in the sequence, partly or wholly replacing the Nardo-Galion swards around the Filipendulo-Iridetum. Only in a few places is the Filipendulo-Iridetum contiguous with both these kinds of communities on the drier and/or less nutrient-rich soils to the landward side and also more maritime vegetation types of salt-marsh and shingle below. Very often now, where the community occurs in these latter kinds of habitats, its upper boundary is an artificial one, either a road or an abrupt transition to improved pasture or cultivated ground. Down-shore, however, the zonations are often very distinctive, particularly around the margins of the western Scottish sea-lochs. Here, Adam (1978,1981) has described a characteristic regional assemblage of salt marsh vegetation types, jiot numerous but, taken together, often species-rich, and frequently developed over rather unusual substrates, highly organic and sometimes amounting to just a thin layer of peat resting on shingle. Such sequences can be seen in whole or part in sites like Loch Ranza on Arran, Loch Gruinart and the Sorn estuary on Islay, Loch Creran in Argyll, Loch Ainort and Loch na h’Airde on Skye, Loch Kishorn, Loch Torridon and the Broom lochs in Wester Ross, on the Sutherland coast and in the Outer Hebrides (Adam et al. 1977, Adam 1978), as well as on Mull and Iona (Gillham 1957Ô) and Shetland (Hilliam 1977, Roper-Lindsay & Say 1986). In the more sheltered of these situations, the Filipendulo-Iridetum usually gives way below to one of the richer forms of the Juncetum gerardi, often the Carex sub-community, less commonly the https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.032 Published online by Cambridge University Press306 Mires Leontodon type and, although I. pseudacorus, O. crocata and F. ulmaria all stop rather abruptly with the move on to more frequently-inundated ground, there is often a strong continuity between the vegetation types in the lower tier of the herbage, with such species as Agrostis stolonifera and Potentilla anserina running throughout as a patchy carpet and Festuca rubra occurring in both. Both the Juncus and Atriplex-Samolus sub-communities of the Filipendulo-Iridetum can be found in such zonations, though the latter type penetrates further into more saline situations and shows a stronger affinity with the salt-marsh swards through the occurrence of Asteretea herbs. At some sites, the junction between the Juncetum gerardi and the Filipendulo-Iridetum is made more striking by the scattered presence of small patches of the Blysmetum rufi in wet shingly hollows and flushes, and then down-shore there is typically a transition to the Puccinellia-t\xvï fucoid sub-community of the Puccinel-lietum. On more exposed coasts, the Juncetum gerardi may be the only real salt-marsh vegetation present below the Filipendulo-Iridetum and even it may be fragmented into small patches of grasses and Potentilla anserina with Bidentetea herbs like Atriplex prostrata and Polygonum hydropiper scattered on the bare sub strate (Gillham 19576). In these Scottish sea-lochs, the salt-marsh often seems to have developed over a shingle base but where such material directly underlies the vegetation, and particularly where considerable amounts of drift-line detritus are deposited, there is a tendency for the Filipendulo-Iridetum to be represented by the Urtica-Galium sub community and for it to grade to eutrophic strandlines where the shingle becomes drier. Galium aparine, Rumex crispus (often obviously var. littoreus), Atriplex pro strata, Stellaria media, Agrostis stolonifera, Festuca rubra and Elymus repens can all provide continuity with the open assemblages of the Atriplex-Urtica strandline, a further community which adds regional distinction to these western Scottish zonations. The accumulation of marsh deposits to heights cap able of supporting the non-halophytic vegetation of the Filipendulo-Iridetum can be considered part of the continuous process of sediment accumulation, but it is hard to see the community as an end-point of marsh succession when it depends so obviously on continuous irrigation by fresh-water draining from the land. It is, rather, an oceanic mire type which happens to find its most striking expression on the maritime fringe, at the junction between fresh and saline habitats. Whether it can progress further in serai developments to scrub and woodland is a separate issue, though it is true that, on the salt-marsh fringe, exposure to winds and rare epi sodes of tidal flooding may make invasion of woody plants particularly unlikely. In some coastal situations, the Filipendulo-Iridetum can be found closely juxtaposed with alder-dominated woodland, though there is no direct evidence of the one having developed into the other. Further inland, where the community can be seen among stretches of wet scrub and woodland, such successions are perhaps more likely, though even there the dense canopy of the herbs may cast a shade inimical to seedlings and young saplings. Distribution "
"m29","Zonation and succession The Hyperico-Potametum typically occurs as small and sometimes fragmentary stands in close association with bog, wet heath, poor fen and aquatic vegetation in zonations and mosaics which probably reflect the duration and extent of inundation and the base-and nutrient-richness of the ground waters. With continuing https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.033 Published online by Cambridge University Press312 Mires impoverished conditions, it is probably essentially stable, though in transitional situations grazing may be important in curtailing any successional developments. In its most common situation on valley mires in southern and south-western Britain, the community is usually found within or around tracts of the Narthecio-Sphagnetum, the characteristic vegetation type of the acid peats of this region accumulating under stagnant waterlogging. Where lines of surface seepage across the peats are clear, the mosaic of communities can be accordingly well-defined, with patches of the dominant H. elodes and P. polygonifolius picking out the stands, scattered over or snaking across the bog. But, in other cases, where the influence of the trickling and fluctuating waters is diffuse, transitions are much less obvious, with Sphagnum auriculatum and such herbs as Narthecium, Drosera rotundifolia, Eriophorum angustifolium and Rhynchospora alba providing strong continuity with the wetter lawns of the mire surface and its Sphagnum auriculatum bog pools. Quite often, these kinds of Hyperico-Potametum soakways are concentrated in a distinct zone on such valley mires. Sometimes, where waters seeping from the slopes around are channelled along the bog edge, the community marks out a marginal belt between the Narthecio-Sphagnetum and the Ericetum tetralicis wet heath that characteristically occupies the seasonally gleyed soils of slightly higher ground. In other situations, it can occur along the inner side of the Narthecio-Sphagnetum, between it and an axial strip of swamp and woodland: here there can also be some seepage and fluctuation of waters, but little enrichment beyond the immediate fringes of the central line of the mire where flow is concentrated. In both these types of zonation, variations on which are well shown in the NCC New Forest Bogs Report (1984), the Hyperico-Potametum is usually clearly marked off from the wet heath, swamp and woodland communities that bound it on the side away from the Narthecio-Sphagnetum. But, where there is gradual enrichment of the waters as they flow from less impoverished ground, or concentrate the nutrients from ever-wider areas, transitions can be more complex. Then, some kind of poor-fen or Junco-Molinion vegetation often occurs in close association with the community. Among the former, the Carex echinata-Sphagnum and Carex rostrata-Sphagnum mires can both be found grading to the Hyperico-Potametum, the Sphagnum carpet running throughout, but species such as C. rostrata, C. demissa, C. echinata, C. nigra, C. panicea, Juncus effusus or J. acutiflorus thickening up as dominants or co-dominants. Molinia can also be locally prominent within such vegetation, but it is much more abundant, often as vigorous tussocks, in the Molinia-Potentilla mire and the Cirsio-Molinietum, both of which, and particularly the former, can mark out zones of soligenous enrichment on somewhat drier ground adjacent to the Hyperico-Potametum, with associates such as Succisa pratensis, Angelica sylvestris and Cir sium palustre becoming frequent. Similar patterns to these latter can be found throughout the south and west of Britain, on lowland heaths and the moorland fringes, where the community marks out seepage and fluctuation zones around base-poor flushes and basins (e.g. Ratcliffe & Hattey 1982). Locally, the Hyperico-Potametum is also seen in seasonally-flooded pools within tracts of wet heath and poor fen and, where these are sufficiently deep, there can be the kind of zonation within stands of the community mentioned earlier. Such layering represents the beginning of a transition to truly aquatic vegetation that occurs more fully where soakways run out of tracts of poor fen and heath into the margins of permanent streams and pools. In the former, where there is an increase in water flow, the aquatic vegetation is often sparse, but around the shelving shores of pools and lakes, the Hyperico-Potametum can pass downwards to other Littorelletea com munities with plants like Littorella uniflora useiî, Myrio-phyllum alternifolium and Isoetes lacustris and I. setacea. Even in their more fully-developed form, such sequences probably rarely, if ever, represent a hydroserai succession and in most situations the community appears to be a stable vegetation type marking out zones where accumulation of any nutrient capital, whether by concentration of dissolved salts or by silting, is unlikely to proceed very far. Where there is some modest enrichment, grazing and trampling may help continually set back any tendency to succession. Distribution "
"m3","Zonation and succession The Eriophorum angustifolium community characteristically forms a minor component in the mosaics of vegetation on intact or modified surfaces of Erico-Sphagnion mires or Ericion tetralicis wet heaths. It may represent a serai stage in the redevelopment of active mire vegetation following disruption. Exceptionally, the community can replace the Sphag-wwm-dominated bog pools in the wetter hollows of patterned Erico-Sphagnion mires, grading, with an increase in the Sphagnum carpet and an appearance of https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.007 Published online by Cambridge University PressM3 Eriophorum angustifolium bog pool community 57 vascular associates, to flat and hummock vegetation. Much more commonly, it forms well-delineated stands on expanses of bare peat which may or may not be flooded, passing to unvegetated ground or open water or, rather sharply, to the mire or wet heath context around. Where it occurs on eroded blanket mire, for example, it occupies part or all of stretches of the flatter gullies between the haggs, giving way to the bare hagg sides or degraded vegetation of eroded peat surfaces. In shallow peat cuttings, the stands often conform to the sharp geometric shapes of the excavations, passing abruptly to the unaltered mire vegetation on the uncut surface around or to its degraded derivatives on drained and much-modified deposits. The occurrence of scattered patches of Sphagnum papillosum and tussocks of Eriophorum vaginatum in some stands suggests that the Eriophorum angustifolium community may sometimes be a precursor to renewed establishment of Erico-Sphagnion mire but such successions have not been followed.Distribution "

"m31","Zonation and succession The community is typically found marking out areas of less vigorous seepage among tracts of montane grasslands and grass-heaths or among snow-bed vegetation, and in such situations it can form intimate mosaics with the Philonoto-Saxifragetum where there is variation in the rate of flow. It is an essentially stable community in the harsh environment in which it characteristically occurs.Distribution "
"m32","Zonation and succession The springs and flushes that characteristically support the Philonoto-Saxifragetum can arise in and flow through a wide variety of vegetation types around our upland fringes and through the montane zone. Either on its own, or in association with other kinds of spring, it can pass to mire, heath or grassland or, at higher altitudes, to bryophyte and lichen communities and snow-bed vegetation. It is essentially a permanent community though, at lower altitudes, could perhaps show some successional development in ungrazed situations. Very often, the Philonoto-Saxifragetum itself marks out the head of a spring or core of a flush, frequently occurring as a small stand of just a few square metres' extent, sometimes much less, or extending as a very narrow strip down rills and the sides of small streams. Quite commonly, a series of such stands will occur across a slope or at its foot, marking some geological disjunction, and, where these are grouped close to one another, they can form a single complex mosaic with the local vegetation types. In very vigorous springs, particularly those on steeper ground where the gradient of waterlogging can die away rapidly, boundaries between the Philonoto-Saxifragetum and its context can be very sharp with next to no floristic continuity between the vegetation types: such stark patterning is often visible in a marked colour contrast between the fresh-green of the spring and the dull-green or russet of its surrounds. In other situations, flushing is more diffuse, with the stands more extensive but much less well-defined from their context, something which is again often visible to the eye from a distance but evident at close quarters in a gradual zonation between the community and its neighbouring vegetation. Even in these latter situations, however, the typical bryophytes of the Philonoto-Saxifragetum and species such as Montia fontana and Chrysosplenium oppositifo-lium rarely extend far out of the spring or flush core and continuity is generally provided by the grasses and sedges that occur in the community. Transitions thus tend to be most gradual where flushes occur within tracts of Nardo-Galion swards such as the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium and Nardus-Galium grasslands which extend into the higher reaches of the sub-montane zone. More abrupt switches can be seen where the Philonoto-Saxifragetum occupies springs emerging in a variety of Nardo-Callunetea dry heaths, Ericion tetralicis wet heath and Erico-Sphagnion blanket mire and among Carice tea curvulae communities of high altitudes. Complications arise where the Philonoto-Saxifragetum passes to other vegetation types of waterlogged ground where the water-flow is less vigorous or where there is some increase in base-or nutrient-richness along the length of a flush or water-track, and such communi ties can form a transition zone around the spring core. At lower altitudes, the Philonoto-Saxifragetum can occur at the head of Carex echinata-Sphagnum mires but in the montane zone it is more often found in association with the Carex-Sphagnum russowii mire which can sur round a spring or rill and grade from it to Calluna-Eriophorum mire. In other cases, high-altitude stands occur with vegetation types of snow-beds or melt-water flushes and streams, such as the Sphagno-Anthelieturn, in which there is less vigorous irrigation, and the Pohlietum glacialis, where there is longer snow-lie and colder waters. Distribution "
"m33","Zonation and succession The Pohlietum is typically found with a very distinctive suite of vegetation types of late snow-beds, variation among which can be related partly to the wetness of the ground. It is sometimes the only kind of spring in such situations, but other related communities sometimes occur with it where the irrigating waters become less frigid or vigorous. Pohlietum springs can vary considerably in size, shape and numbers, but they generally occur towards the base of snow-beds, giving way sharply above to vegetation of more freely-draining ground, which may not be fully exposed by the melting snow until early summer. Here, the Poly trichum-Kiaeria community is very characteristic, providing a further locus for Saxifraga stellaris but otherwise showing little floristic continuity with the Pohlietum even in those patches where there is intermittent irrigation by melt-water or rain. Often, too, there are stands of the Salix-Racomitrium community on moister soils with much solifluction. Then, around these, on ground with less extensive snow-lie, there can be zones of the Deschampsia-Galium community and the Carex-Racomitrium and Car ex-Poly trichum montane heaths. With increasing distance from the spring-head, where snow-lie is not so long and the irrigating waters a little warmer, though still flowing vigorously, the Pohlietum may give way to the Philonoto-Saxifragetum along the melt-water rills and on the flushed ground around. Here, continuity among the herbs and some of the associated bryophytes is considerable, though there is the marked shift in dominance in the ground carpet. Where waterflow is considerably reduced, there can also be flushed banks of the Sphagno-Anthelieturn julaceae. In patterns such as these, the Pohlietum forms an integral part of a complex of vegetation types associated with one of our most extreme habitats. Particularly fine suites of the communities can be seen in the Cairngorms, on the upper slopes of Ben Alder and Aonach Mor, in the Creag Meagaidh corries and on the high slopes of the Affrich hills, all in Inverness and on Beinn Deargh and Am Faochagach in Ross.

"m36",""
"m37","Zonation and succession The Cratoneuron-Festuca spring is generally found as an integral part of very characteristic sequences of our more calcicolous upland communities, developed over ground that is progressively drier. Topographic and edaphic variation over exposures of lime-rich substrates can modify and fragment such zonations and grazing and trampling also often play a part in influencing the vegetation pattern. Very commonly, the Cratoneuron-Festuca community marks out springs and seepage lines within tracts of calcicolous grasslands developed over drier rendzina soils or calcareous brown earths. Stands are typically small, frequently less than 1 m2, though more extensive banks and curtains can sometimes be found, and where there is a repeated pattern of irrigation at points along a slope, whole series of springs can pick this out. In rockier situations, where seepage occurs directly from bedding planes in exposures, the stands are often well defined, with a sharp disjunction from the surrounds but, with more diffuse irrigation, particularly over gentle slopes that are open to grazing, much more gradual transitions can be seen. The kinds of sward that surround the Cratoneuron-Festuca spring vary with the region and, within regions, with altitude. A common context is provided by the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, the typical plagioclimax pasture of moist calcareous soils through much of the north-western uplands of Britain and a community which, on the flushed surrounds of springs, can grade to the Cratoneuron-Festuca vegetation through its Carex or Saxifraga-Ditrichum sub-communities. On the https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.041 Published online by Cambridge University PressM37 Cratoneuron commutatum-Festuca rubra spring 337 limestones of the north Pennines, exactly parallel sequences can be seen between the springs and the Sesleria-Galium grassland which largely replaces the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland in this part of Bri tain, and which also has a Carex sub-community of moister soils. On the metamorphosed sugar-limestone of Upper Teesdale, the very distinctive Carex capillaris-Kobresia sub-community of the Sesleria-Galium grassland can be found in such patterns. Small-sedge fens of the Pinguiculo-Caricetum also often occur on the strongly-flushed ground around or below Cratoneuron-Festuca springs and, where this community is interposed between the spring and the grassland, much more gradual transitions can be seen through the sequence of vegetation types with bryophytes such as Cratoneuron commutatum, Bryum pseudotriquetrum and Aneura pinguis running on into the flush as a broken carpet among the now much richer herb layer. At higher altitudes, in the Scottish Highlands, for example, the Cratoneuron-Festuca spring can extend up to almost 1000 m and here it can be found among the more montane calcicolous communities like the Fes tuca-Alchemilla-Silene dwarf herb vegetation, an important context over the mica-schist slopes and banks of the Dalradian deposits. At these higher altitudes, too, there is a tendency for the Pinguiculo-Caricetum to be replaced by the Cariceto-Saxifragetum over the strongly-irrigated ground of open stony flushes below Cratoneuron-Festuca springs. In more gradual transitions between the community and the surrounds, developed over gentler slopes, trampling by grazing stock or deer often plays an important part in maintaining the characteristically open con ditions of the flushed soils. Typically, the Cratoneuron-Festuca spring itself is inaccessible to such treatment and heavy trampling is undoubtedly deleterious to the bryophyte mat. Such influences may indeed help convert the vegetation to a Caricion davallianae flush where springs occur on ground that is opened to pasturing, with an increase in the cover and diversity of smaller herbs able to exploit the lack of competition. The much richer Cratoneuron-Carex community described largely from Moor House in Cumbria (Eddy et al. 1969; see also Huntley 1979) may represent a stage in such a process. In most circumstances, the Cratoneuron-Festuca spring appears to be a permanent community maintained by the edaphic and climatic conditions of the environment and, even where long ungrazed, it is un likely that progression to any kind of woody vegetation is easy because of the impoverished character of the waters and soils. Where conditions are a little more eutrophic, however, lack of grazing could perhaps permit the spread of taller herbs. Over inaccessible dripping cliff's, the Cratoneuron-Festuca spring can sometimes be found with the Alchemilla-Saxifraga tail herb community, in which C. commutatum and B. pseudo triquetrum form a patchy ground layer beneath tumbling masses of S. aizoides and a variety of calcicolous and mesophytic montane herbs. Distribution "
"m38","Zonation and succession The Cratoneuron-Carex spring typically occurs as a local replacement for the Cratoneuron-Festuca spring in sequences of grazed calcicolous communities in upland Britain, where much of the floristic variation can be related to differences in topography and soils. Commonly, therefore, the community picks out defi nite springs or flushes within stretches of calcicolous swards developed over drier rendzinas or brown soils. Individual stands are often small, although where vigorous irrigation runs down-slope flushed zones can be very elongated and springs can be very numerous within quite small areas, occurring repeatedly along valley sides. Where they emerge among rockier topography, the stands can be well defined from their surrounds but often here there is quite a gradual transition to the grassland, the extent and richness of the bryophyte mat declining but many of the small herbs retaining high frequency and cover into the sward. In Upper Teesdale, it is generally the Sesleria-Galium grassland which provides the context for the Cratoneuron-Carex spring, grading to it through the Carex or Carex-Kobresia sub communities. Over somewhat less base-rich profiles both there and in Scotland, the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland can be found in similar sequences and this, too, can show transitions to the spring via its intermediate Carex sub-community. Often, a zone of the Pinguiculo-Caricetum is interposed over the strongly-flushed ground between the spring and the wet grassland, further attenuating the floristic gradation over the space of several metres, with quite gentle shifts among the bryophyte and herb layer in moving from the stagnogley to the rendzinas. At higher altitudes in the central Highlands, such vegetation types can be replaced by the Cariceto-Saxifragetum and the Festuca-Alche-milla-Silene dwarf-herb community around Cratoneuron-Carex springs. Trampling and grazing in these kinds of zonations play an important part in keeping the vegetation open and varied and may be vital in maintaining the rich calcicolous flora characteristic of the community (Eddy et al. 1969). Indeed, such treatment may help mediate a succession from the more species-poor Cratoneuron-Festuca spring to this kind of vegetation but the continuing extreme wetness of the ground probably prevents https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.042 Published online by Cambridge University Press342 Mires further development to a Caricion davallianae sward. Withdrawal of grazing is unlikely to be accompanied by a pronounced expansion of mesophytic herbs because of the impoverished soil conditions, although it is possible that some limited increase in plants such as Saxifraga aizoides, Alchemilla glabra, Filipendula ulmaria and Geum rivale could produce a fragmentary tail-herb vegetation. Distribution "
"m4","Zonation and succession The community is typically found within or alongside Erico-Sphagnion mires, such as the Erica-Sphagnum papillosum raised or basin mire, or Ericion wet heaths, notably the Scirpus-Erica wet heath, either alone in fairly well-defined bog pools and soakways or in more complex mosaics with other poor-fen communities in more extensive soligenous areas. Most often, it marks out the wettest areas in the latter where water movement is quite diffuse, commonly passing to a fringe or watertrack of the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire on shallower and firmer peats where the throughput is more pronounced. In some places, Littorelletea communities occur alongside the Carex rostrata-Sphagnum recurvum mire in such complexes. The place of the community in terrestrialising successions is obscure. As with the Rhynchosporion bog pools, this kind of vegetation may be very stable provided the high water-table and modest irrigation are maintained. The most common changes encountered now are probably those caused by drainage which produces a demise of the more aquatic Sphagna and perhaps a transition to the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire with, where there is grazing, a spread of Juncus dominance. Distribution "
"m5","Zonation and succession The Carex-Sphagnum squarrosum mire is characteristically found in zonations and mosaics related to variation in water-level, base-status, cation and nutrient content of the waters and substrates. Such patterns can reflect a process of succession but many seem to be static at the present time. The simplest sequences are seen in open-water transitions like those described from Scottish lakes by Spence (1964) where the community typically occurs behind a front of the Caricetum rostratae (sometimes with C. lasiocarpa locally prominent) or the Equisetetum fluviatile, with the Phragmitetum sometimes represented as a bank of reed beyond the other swamps or on the transition to the mineral soils around the basin. At scattered localities, the Caricetum vesicariae is part of such zonations and the whole sequence may be terminated to the landward side by the Phalar ide turn. Sometimes, the Carex-Sphagnum squarrosum mire is an extensive component of the middle portion of these patterns, in other cases it is but a local patchy development within tracts of the Potentillo-Caricetum, perhaps representing more oligotrophic nuclei. Much more complex mosaics are characteristic of those sites where the Carex-Sphagnum squarrosum mire occurs as part of soligenous sequences. Here, below springs and around tortuous seepage lines and streams, it can form part of a perplexing mixture of poor and rich fens, notably with the Potentillo-Caricetum and the Carex-Calliergon mires, with the Pinguiculo-Caricetum on more solid base-rich peats and peaty gleys around, https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press64 Mires and Filipendulion vegetation on mesotrophic alluvium, the whole closely hemmed in by Ericion tetralicis and Erico-Sphagnion vegetation on the ombrogenous deposits above the lagg. As Proctor (1974) showed at Malham Tarn, such patterns have a clear underlying structure in relation to the environmental variables discussed earlier, even though its expression at particular sites can present a superficial picture of great confusion. Further studies of this kind are needed to give a precise indication of what conditions control the development of this or that kind of poor or rich fen and how the general process of terrestrialisation interacts with the differentiation of flushed and leached areas within mire complexes. We may then be able to see where the Carex-Sphagnum squarrosum community fits in succes-sional sequences. In the kinds of mires in which it occurs, two lines of serai development seem possible. In more base-rich complexes, the community is often found in close juxtaposition with the Salix pentandra-Carex ros trata woodland, the field layer of which has much in common with this kind of mire (Proctor 1974, Adam et al. 1975, Lock & Rodwell 1981) and which, at Crag Lough, seems certainly to have developed from a mosaic of the Carex-Sphagnum squarrosum mire and the Potentillo-Caricetum with release from grazing (Lock & Rod well 1981). Where the balance is tipped towards the more base-poor and oligotrophic side, it is possible that some kinds of Betula-Molinia woodland (the Sphagnum or Juncus effusus sub-communities, for example) are a natural successor. The Carex-Sphagnum squarrosum mire may itself play an important part in the differentiation of more oligotrophic nuclei that are preferentially invaded by Betula pubescens, though this line of development is probably greatly speeded where mires are drained but not subject to too much surface disturbance and eutrophication of the peats. Such successions can be seen locally in lowland flood-plain mires, where different mire and woodland types are involved (Wheeler 1978, 1980c) and seem to have been extensive in the past (e.g. Walker 1970), though, at the present time, many zonations in which the Carex-Sphagnum squarrosum mire is found look to be more or less stable. Distribution "
"m6","Zonation and succession The Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire typically occurs as small stands among other mire communities, grasslands and heaths and sometimes with swamps and spring vegetation, where zonations are related to the water regime and the base-and nutrient-status of the environment. Grazing, especially where combined with drainage, can convert the community to grasslands and exclusion of herbivores would be expected to permit progression to wet scrub and woodland, though this would, in many cases, probably be slow and patchy. Where the community occurs within or alongside mires, it usually marks out linear tracks where there is an obvious channelling of soligenous waters on the sloping peat surface, as on blanket and raised mires, or around the margins, as in the lagg of raised and basin mires. It can be found in association with all the major Erico-Sphagnion communities. In more oceanic areas, it occurs with the Scirpus-Eriophorum blanket mire, where https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.010 Published online by Cambridge University Press70 Mires Figure 13.

Further east, low-altitude Calluna-Eriophorum blanket mire provides a common context for the Juncus effusus sub-community, generally its Sphagnum recur-vum variant (Eddy et al. 1969). The community is also found with the Erica-Sphagnum papillosum raised mire and occasionally as a strip alongside the central zone of more acidic valley bogs with the Narthecio-Sphagnetum mire (Rose 1953). In such situations, it may occur in close association with Littorelletea pools and pass laterally to the drier mire surface with changes in the Sphagnum carpet and a switch to dominance of the vascular plants of the active plane. Rather more com plex patterns can be seen where the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire occupies the wetter areas within tracts of degraded or disturbed peat, where it is often found with the Scirpus-Erica wet heath to the far-west (Figure 13) or the Erica-Sphagnum compactum wet heath further east, https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.010 Published online by Cambridge University PressM6 Carex echinata-Sphagnum recurvum)auriculatum mire 71 and fragmentary recolonising vegetation, in pools and over redistributed peat and on streamside gravels and alluvium. On the gentler slopes of the upland fringes, the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire picks out seepage areas and water tracks where there is local accumulation of peat or a peaty topsoil to gleys of various kinds. Here, the sharpness of the vegetation boundaries is very variable according to the degree of flushing. With diffuse irrigation, there may be a very gradual transition to the surrounding grassland or heath; where waters emerge from vigorous springs or are channelled,into definite trickles and streams, the junctions are correspondingly sharp and stands can be clearly seen and mapped from a great distance (and from aerial photographs), particularly if the dominants are rushes or if the Sphagnum carpet is well developed. The way the distribution of the community can provide an effective indication of the drainage system is well seen on the published maps of Cader Idris in Dyfed (Edgell 1969) and of Moor House in Cumbria (Eddy et al. 1969). Where waters originate from definite springs, the community may pass upstream, and fragmentarily along its length, to the Philonoto-Saxifragetum. Laterally, around its margins, there is usually a transition to Nardo-Galion or Juncion acutiflori grasslands, or to heaths, as the peat thins to a humose topsoil over less strongly-gleyed profiles. These communities, particularly the grasslands, have some species in common with the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire and, where grazing stock have access, there may be a strong continuity among the sedges and dicotyledons, blurring the boundary. Where the community occurs on drift-smeared slopes, outlying patches of the mire may mark areas of local waterlogging in hollows and on gentle slopes, creating a mosaic with the grasslands and heaths and, where uncontrolled grazing has allowed a spread of rushes over generally poorly-drained ground, this may mask the patterning among the smaller herbs and bryophytes. Long-continued grazing, especially on naturally drier soils or where there has been some drainage, probably converts the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire to the Jun-cus-Galium mire or swards dominated by mixtures of Nardus stricta and Juncus squarrosus. And with a con certed attempt at improvement with drainage and lime and fertiliser application, lower-altitude stands can be reduced to narrow strips of wet ground within pastures of Lolio-Cynosuretum. At all stages, neglect and blockage of drains may permit a reversion. A combination of grazing on drier fringes and pro nounced waterlogging elsewhere helps prevent the es tablishment of woody plants in the community but where these get a hold, they would probably lead to the development of the Salix-Galium woodland or the wet ter forms of the Betula-Molinia woodland. Under existing conditions, however, the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire seems to be a substantially stable component of the sub-montane landscape. Distribution "
"m7","Zonation and succession The community is typically found as small stands, most commonly in association with high-altitude Calluna-Eriophorum blanket mire, usually of the Vaccinium-Hylocomium sub-community (the Empetreto-Eriophore-tum of McVean & Ratcliffe 1962), within which it can occupy hollows or drainage channels or form part of recolonising vegetation over eroded areas (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Eddy et al. 1969). Transitional zones around such stands of the Carex-Sphagnum russowii mire are often marked by an increase in Eriophorum vaginatum and a shift towards dominance of S. papillosum in the moss carpet. In other situations, the community can mark out spring or seepage lines within tracts of montane moss-heaths like the Carex bigelowii-Polytri-chum alpinum or Racomitrium-Carex bigelowii communities, or high-level grasslands dominated by Nardus stricta or Juncus squarrosus, sometimes occurring in mosaics with floristically-related snow-bed vegetation. Where there is strong flushing, the community is often Floristic table M7found around the Philonoto-Saxifragetum spring and rill community. Most of the occurrences of the Car ex-Sphagnum russowii mire are close to or above the potential forest limit in the Scottish Highlands and the community is probably an essentially stable component of the vege tation pattern under present-day conditions; and it would probably remain so were grazing to be much reduced. Distribution "
"m8","Zonation and succession The Carex-Sphagnum warnstorfii mire typically occurs as small stands which can be sharply marked off from unirrigated surrounds or which can form part of swamp and mire complexes where water-depth and degree of base-richness influence the vegetation patterns. In the former situation, the community can occupy stagnant hollows in tracts of montane grasslands with a fringe of irrigated sward between, or mark out areas of baseenrichment below high-altitude ombrogenous bog, usually the Calluna-Eriophorum mire. In more extensive soligenous areas, it can be seen in zonations analogous to those in which the Carex-Sphagnum squarrosum mire occurs at lower altitudes, with the Caricetum rostratae replacing it towards open water and patches of the Carex curta-Sphagnum russowii and Car ex-Calliergon mires indicating areas with a waning or increasing influence of base-richness. The frequent presence of seedlings of Salix aurita in stands of the community may indicate a tendency to wards the development of montane willow scrub but such successions have never been seen to progress further. Distribution "
"m9","Zonation and succession The community is typically found among suites of swamps and mires whose distribution is related to the water regime of the environment and the base-status and calcium content of the waters and substrates. In some places, such zonations obviously reflect successions with increasing terrestrialisation but, in more oligotrophic situations, serai progression may be slow and, in isolated sites, woody seed-parents may be very remote. Under certain conditions, it is also possible that succession tends not to the establishment of mire forest but ultimately to ombrogenous bog. The simplest sequences in which the Carex-Calliergon mire occurs are found in open-water transitions around lakes and pools with more base-rich waters, as in limestone and drift basins towards the upland northwest. Here, the community is often fronted by stands of the Caricetum rostratae or Equisetetum fluviatile swamps (or, in parts of Scotland, the Caricetum vesicar-iae) extending out into deeper open water (Holdgate 1955/?, Spence 1964). More locally, in this kind of site, the Cladietum marisci may be represented in the zonation: it is especially well-developed in the Anglesey fens (Wheeler 1980zz, b), though in the cooler conditions at higher latitudes and altitudes becomes increasingly sparse (e.g. Holdgate 1955/?). Very commonly, the Carex-Calliergon mire forms a mosaic behind the swamp zone with the Potentillo-Caricetum, also often developed as a floating raft, within which there may also be a local occurrence of the Carex-Sphagnum squarro sum mire: through all of these, Carex rostrata, Erio phorum angustifolium, Potentilla palustris and Menyanthes may form a continuous backdrop to the differentiation of diagnostic suites of bryophytes and herbs in the various fens. Where there is any development of woody vegetation in such sequences, it is generally of the Salix-Carex type, characterised by rather diverse canopies of willows, in which Salix pen-tandra generally figures prominently, over a field layer that retains a strong floristic continuity with the sur rounding fen. A more or less complete sequence of this general type is well seen at Malham Tarn (Proctor 1974, Adam et al. 1975).At this site, too, it is possible to see some complications of this basic pattern. First, since base-and calcium-enrichment are strongly dependent on springs which debouch water from calcareous bedrocks (Carboniferous Limestone in this case), the Carex-Calliergon mire occurs closely juxtaposed to calcifugous mire vegetation more remote from soligenous influence or elevated above the ground water-table on ombrogenous peats. Directly comparable abrupt floristic contrasts can be seen where the community occurs locally around more base-rich flushes in stretches of blanket mire or wet heath in Scotland, where the basins are often insufficiently extensive for swamps to be represented, but where montane mires, like the Carex-Sphagnum warnstorfii community, and spring vegetation, like the Car-ici-Saxifragetum aizoidis, may also be represented (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Birks 1973). Second, where calcareous conditions are maintained over shallower peats running away around the fringe of the basin, the Carex-Calliergon mire gives way at Mal ham, and around soligenous base-rich flushes on upland slopes, to the Pinguiculo-Caricetum dioicae, a community with which it shows quite strong floristic affinities but where species like Carex rostrata, C. diandra, Potentilla palustris and Menyanthes fade in importance and where there is a stronger representation of Caricion davallia-nae plants. Third, on fairly moist and firm peats or peaty allu vium where there is a greater measure of nutrient enrichment, the Carex-Calliergon mire can pass to Molinietalia vegetation in which tall herbs become consistently prominent, together with plants like Molinia caerulea and/or Juncus subnodulosus. At Malham, such vegetation is represented by the rather particular Molinia caerulea-Crepis paludosa community, as well as the more widely distributed Filipendula ulmaria-Angelica sylvestris community (Proctor 1974, Adam et al. 1975). Similar transitions can be seen at Sunbiggin Tarn (Holdgate 1955/?) and around some Scottish lochs (Spence 1964) and, where the Carex-Calliergon mire occurs very locally in fens in eastern England, it is generally in a context of Junco-Molinion fen-meadows (Wheeler 1980/?, c). The very distinctive occurrences of the community in Broadland preserve the general features of the swamp/ fen transitions outlined above but the vegetation types represented are somewhat different, the mosaics very intricate and their origin, as noted above, rather special. In this area, the Carex-Calliergon mire occurs in inti mate contact with various types of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum (notably the Cicuta sub-community) and was grouped within that association by Wheeler (1978, 1980«) as a distinct caricetosum. These mosaics, together with tracts of the Cladietum marisci and some speciesrich types of Phragmitetum, occupy the turf-ponds and https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.013 Published online by Cambridge University PressM9 Carex rostrata-Calliergon cuspidatum!giganteum mire 93 are surrounded by stretches of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum, Schoenus and Myrica sub-communities on the firmer, uncut peats. Cladium is generally the present fen dominant (and is regularly mown) and seems to have figured prominently in the relatively short successional life of this quite striking vegetation in the disused cuttings (Giller & Wheeler 1986«). Throughout its range, at least at lower altitudes and in less remote sites, the Car ex-Calliergon mire is probably a successional stage to the development of Salicion ciner-eae mire forest, to the north the Salix-Carex woodland, to the south-east the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland. The maintenance of a generally high water-table or irregular fluctuations in water-level may hinder invasion by woody plants and, in Broadland, mowing for sedge can repeatedly set back colonisation but, where the fen mat begins to emerge permanently more than a few centimetres above the water level, progression to woodland is probably potentially quite rapid. There is also the possibility that the Carex-Calliergon mire is serai to the development of poor-fen and ombrogenous mire, through the local formation of Sphagnum nuclei, a progression to the Car ex-Sphagnum squarrosum mire and selective invasion by Betula pubescens. Such a sere seems to be in operation in the Ant valley fens, where the Sphagnum sub-community of the Salix-Betula-Phrag-mites woodland forms striking islands in the fen, and it perhaps heralds the development of Betula-Molinia woodland and some kind of 5/?/ztzgwwm-dominated bog. Distribution "
"mc1","Zonation and succession Seawards, the Crithmo-Spergularietum overlaps with and grades into the grey xeric-supralittoral lichen zone,generally occupied by the Ramalinetum scopularis (DR 1925) Klem. 1955 (Fletcher 1973a, b; James et al 1977). Above, there is usually an abrupt transition to the Festuca-Armeria maritime grassland on deeper, moister soils in less maritime conditions. In some cases, the zonation occurs gradually over progressively deeper and less saline soils through the Crithmum sub-community of the grassland. Where excessively-drained soils occurabove the most maritime zone on cliffs, the Crithmo-Spergularietum gives way to the Armeria-Cerastium community. On sea-walls, the association may be replaced by crevice vegetation which has a mixture of maritime andinland mural species like the Cymbalarietum. There is no evidence of any successional progression from Crithmo-Spergularietum. Distribution "
"mc10","Zonation and succession This maritime grassland generally occurs as a zone on grazed sea-cliffs above the Festuca-Armeria community (into which it may grade through the Armeria sub-community) and at roughly the same level as the Festuca-Holcus community. As such, it forms part of the sequence of cliff grasslands developed in relation to decreasing maritime influence on moving inland. Above it usually passes to maritime forms of heath or acid grassland. It may also form zonations with the Festuca-Armeria and Festuca-Holcus grasslands in response to variations in grazing pressure and with increased inaccessibility to stock it can grade to these communities through their sub-association of Plantago spp. (Figure 23). The zonation of the various sub-communities reflects the influence of both salt-spray deposition and soil patterns. The Armeria sub-community usually forms a zone seaward of the C. panicea sub-community and the Schoenus sub-community occurs patchily within the latter where there is pronounced flushing. Grazing probably mediates a successional relationship between the Festuca-Plantago community and both the Festuca-Armeria and Festuca-Holcus communities, particularly the latter. It is possible that the C. panicea sub-community develops from wet maritime heath where this is heavily grazed. Distribution "
"mc11","Zonation and succession The community usually occurs as a fairly narrow zone inland of the Brassica cliff-edge community or some-times the Crithmo-Spergularietum crevice vegetation. On particularly sheltered cliffs, it may be the most maritime vegetation. The three sub-communities may themselves be zoned in relation to maritime influence with the Bromus, Ononis and Sanguisorba sub-communities succeeding one another on moving inland (Figure 24). Above, the Festuca-Daucus community usually passes to calcareous grassland or scrub. The community may occur at the same level on cliffs as the Festuca-Holcus grassland and grade to it through the Dactylis sub-community of the latter with an increase in soil moisture.Distribution "
"mc12","Zonation and succession The community occurs at about the same level on cliffs as maritime heaths, grading below to Festuca-Holcus maritime grassland. Despite the representation of scrub and woodland species within the community, there is little evidence of any succession from or to such com-munities. It is hard to see how some stands of the Festuca-Hyacinthoides community could have ever carried a shrub or tree canopy; nor are they ever likely to develop one in even the moderate exposure to salt-spray. The spread of Pteridium aquilinum may likewise be inhibited by maritime influence but it is possible that high levels of soil moisture also play a part in preventing its spread. Distribution "
"mc2","Zonation and succession Towards high-water mark, the community grades into the Ramalinetum scopularis lichen zone which, in shel-tered sites in western Scotland, may have some of the larger foliose lichens characteristic of Lobarion commu-nities (James et al. 1977). Above, there is often a transi-tion to the Festuca-Armeria maritime grassland, sometimes abrupt, in other cases more gradual through the Ligusticum variant of the typical sub-community of the grassland. On some very tall cliffs, where there are more sheltered ledges above, there may be a switch from the Armeria-Ligusticum community to the Rhodiola-Armeria community before an intact grassland develops. Where waterlogged saline soils occur on ledges or abut onto low cliff-tops, the community is replaced by perched salt-marsh vegetation of the Leontodon sub-community of the Juncetum gerardi.

"mc3","Zonation and succession Stands of the community are generally discrete but may form part of a fragmented zonation up cliffs from the Armeria-Ligusticum maritime rock-crevice community to a more intact Festuca-Armeria maritime grassland or maritime heath above.

"mc4","Zonation and succession The Brassica community can constitute the most mari-time vegetation on relatively sheltered, dry calcareous cliffs though it occurs occasionally above a zone of Crithmo-Spergularietum.

"mc5","Zonation and succession The community usually occurs in mosaics with other maritime vegetation types which vary according to the degree of maritime influence and the rock type. The Desmazeria sub-community is found at the level of the Crithmo-Spergularietum and typical Festuca-Armeria grassland and the Anthyllis sub-community within the Festuca-Armeria and Festuca-Holcus grasslands. The Armeria sub-community occurs in the zone of the Festuca-Holcus grassland and maritime heaths and the Arenaria sub-community in comparable positions within the Brassica and Festuca-Daucus communities. Gradations to each of the surrounding communities may be gentle or sharp according to the change in soil depth. There is some evidence that the Armeria-Cerastium community may initiate colonisation of disturbed and eroding rock surfaces on cliffs, being succeeded by the vegetation characteristic of the particular more stable combination of exposure and lithology.

"mc6","Zonation and succession The Atriplici-Betetum usually represents the most mari-time vegetation where it occurs, replacing the Crithmo-Spergularietum or Armeria-Ligusticum community though it also occurs higher up cliffs in the zone normally occupied by the Festuca-Armeria maritime grassland(Figure 20). Fragments of each of these communities may occur in mosaics with the Atriplici-Betetum where the effect of sea-birds is not too severe and may be able toexpand if sites are abandoned by the birds. Very intense or prolonged activity may result in the total degeneration https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.061 Published online by Cambridge University Press282 Maritime cliff communities of the normal maritime vegetation (see Sobey 1976 on the Isle of May). Foreshore stands occur with other strandline vegetation like the Honkenya-Cakile and Matricaria-Galium communities. DistributionThe community occurs patchily around the cliffed coasts and foreshores of the south and west extending north into Scotland. Particularly fine examples are found in sites less subject to human disturbance of nesting sea-birds as on islands. The distribution of Lavatera arborea within the community is probably limited by climatic factors: Okusanya (1979c) has shown this species to be injured by low temperatures and destroyed by slight frosts (-5 °C). Affinities As described here, the community includes some of the vegetation noted in accounts of sea-bird colonies Figure 20. Vegetation of sea-bird cliffs at St Govan's Chapel, Stackpole. MCI Crithmo-Spergularietum vegetation occurs in crevices on the lower spray-splashed stretches of the cliffs at this site but is replaced by luxuriant stands of MC6 Atriplici-Betetum vegetation beneath ledges occupied by nesting guillemots and gulls. Higher up the cliffs, as the influence of spray becomes less intense, there are ledges with, first, the Crithmum sub-community of MC8 Festuca-Armeria vegetation, then the Holcus sub-community.

"mc7","Zonation and succession As with the Atriplici-Betetum community, this vegeta-tion forms a mosaic with surrounding maritime crevice communities and grasslands and its spatial and tempo-ral relationships with these are likely to be governed bythe intensity of sea-bird activity and the high maritimeinfluence. Distribution "
"mc8","On ungrazed cliffs, the Festuca-Armeria community generally forms a zone above the Crithmo-Spergularietum or the Armeria-Ligusticum crevice communities into which it may grade through its Crithmum or Ligusticum sub-communities. Above it may pass into the Festuca-Holcus maritime grassland through its Holcus sub-community (Figure 21). This is the general zonation on the cliffs of much of south-west England, Wales and southern Scotland, though on chalk and limestones there is a tendency for the Crithmum sub-community to pass directly into cliff-top Festuca-Daucus maritime grassland. On grazed cliffs, the Plantago coronopus sub-community may replace all other sub-communities and pass above into the Festuca-Plantago maritime grassland. This zonation is characteristic of much of the cliffed coast of north-west Scotland. Throughout its range, the Festuca-Armeria grassland may give way on very shallow dry soils to various types of Armeria-Cerastium community, particularly the Anthyllis sub-community."
"mc9","Zonation and succession The Festuca-Holcus grassland usually occupies a zone between the Festuca-Armeria grassland, into which it passes through the Holcus sub-community of the latter, and maritime types of heath. In especially shelteredsituations, it may be the most maritime community on cliffs. Grazing probably mediates a successional relation-ship with the Festuca-Plantago maritime grassland. Distribution "
"mg1","Zonation and succession Some of the most frequent zonations involving Arrhenatheretum stands are the often sharp juxtapositions of the various sub-communities and variants with one another or with other vegetation types along road margins. Such patterns are very varied and sometimes reflect long, local traditions of boundary construction and maintenance. Where stands are not maintained by cutting, zonations are generally a reflection of stages in succession to mixed deciduous woodland. This succession is most often mediated by grazing. Arrhenatherum is a ready invader of soils and calcareous talus exposed by land slip, construction work or the abandonment of ploughed land. It can also spread into and increase in certain other grassland types where grazing is absent or withdrawn or where there is injudicious pastoral treatment. Resumption of grazing can once more reduce its cover. Hope-Simpson (19406) noted that, within four years of the removal of rabbits from a primitive Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis sward at War Down, Hampshire, Arrhenatherum previously no more than occasional, had become very abundant. Within seven years of the resumption of grazing by sheep and rabbits on an Arrhenatheretum at nearby Coulter's Dean Wasteland, the vegetation had been converted to a Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis grassland with no Arrhenatherum (Hope-Simpson 19406). Thomas (1960, 1963) showed that, after the virtual elimination of rabbits by myxomatosis, the coarser grasses characteristic of the Arrhenatheretum were among those species which spread in grasslands and heaths on chalk. These had previously been present in small amounts and had provided a valuable winter-green bite for the rabbits. They were reduced in cover when rabbit numbers rose again. Arrhenatherum can also spread into seeded verges and some of the floristic variation within the Festuca rubra sub-community (see above) is attributable to this advance. Increase of Arrhenatherum in Centaureo-Cynosuretum grasslands seems to follow careless grazing, perhaps by the use of such grasslands as horse-pad docks, and the Centaurea nigra sub-community of the Arrhenatheretum may originate partly in this way. Ploughing and subsequent abandonment of land after unsuccessful arable cultivation seems to have been a fairly widespread factor in the development of some of the more extensive stands of the community, especially on deeper soils over chalk. The Arrhenatheretum at Coulter's Dean Wasteland had developed on land ploughed and abandoned some 30 years before (Tansley & Adamson 1925). Brenchley & Adam (1915) had reported a similar occurrence of the community on the abandoned and ungrazed Broadbalk Wilderness at Rothamsted. Several subsequent studies (Lloyd & Pigott 1967 in the Chilterns, Grubb et al. 1969 at Lullington Heath, Sussex and Wells et al. 1976 at Porton Down on the Hampshire/Wiltshire border) have con firmed the view that the Arrhenatheretum is one of the communities dominated by coarse grasses which can, in the absence of grazing, develop naturally on the chalk without the prior development of a Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis sward. The Arrhenathereta described in these studies are of the kind classified here as the Pastinaca and Centaurea nigra sub-communities but the lists provided are generally insufficiently precise to allocate stands unequivocally to one or the other. The available data suggest that the Pastinaca sub-community develops on the more calcareous and oligotrophic soils where these have been exposed by ploughing or where there has been a relaxation of grazing of calcicolous grassland. This sub community is most common on the chalk of the south and east where P. sativa has its centre of distribution in Britain and where there has been a history of unsuccessful arable cultivation of marginal chalkland and pas toral neglect (see, for example, Smith 1980). The Cen taurea sub-community is more widespread and seems to develop on more mesotrophic soils which are generally less calcareous. It is perhaps the more natural sub community on deeper soils over chalk, such as those derived from superficial deposits, but it may also develop by the relaxation of grazing of mesotrophic grasslands throughout the lowlands, especially where this has been combined with application of fertilisers. Similar differences in the trophic state of soils may be an important factor in controlling whether it is Arrhenatheretum (of any kind) or grassland dominated by other coarse species such as Avenulapubescens, Festuca rubra, Bromus erectus and Brachypodium pinnatum which develops in any given situation. Wells et al. (1976) showed that, at Porton, the Arrhenatheretum occurred on land ploughed relatively recently where, they sug gested, there was still a comparatively small accumulation of organic matter and mineral nutrients. Other coarse grassland types had developed on soils ploughed less recently which were consequently richer. If any kind of Arrhenatheretum remains ungrazed and https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.005 Published online by Cambridge University PressMGI Arrhenatheretum elatioris grassland uncut it eventually develops a pronounced tussock physiognomy and litter accumulation depresses speciesrichness. Shrubs invade and the frequently close hedgerows and field boundaries provide a seed source. Foremost among the invaders is Crataegus monogyna with Prunus spinosa, Sambucus nigra (especially where there has been disturbance and soil eutrophication), Rubus fruticosus agg., Rosa spp. and, on the more calcareous soils, Cornus sanguinea, Viburnum lantana and Ligus-trum vulgare. Clematis vitabla may form a tangle among the developing scrub. Eventually, succession progresses to some form of mixed deciduous woodland but even very coarse and scrubby Arrhenatheretum can be con verted to a low sward by grazing. At Aston Rowant NNR, Oxfordshire, four years of sheep-grazing in winter and spring drastically reduced the height of a scrubby Arrhenatheretum and converted A. elatius itself from large tussocks to small scattered shoots in a ground of Festuca ovina (Wells 1969: compare especially Figures 1 and 2). Distribution "
"mg10","Zonation and succession The community very commonly occurs in mosaics related to patterns of soil moisture. The Typical sub community is very frequent as patches and sometimes as extensive stands in damper hollows in the Lolio-Cynosuretum and Centaureo-Cynosuretum and distinctive patterns often reflect the occurrence of ridge-and-furrow or drains that are too widely spaced, rushy strips picking out the wetter bands of soil. The Juncus inflexus sub-community is encountered in less well-drained areas within more calcareous soils in the Alopecurus-Sangui-sorba flood-meadow and the more calcicolous types of Centaureo-Cynosuretum. The Iris sub-community occurs in often very prominent patches in alluvial Lolio-Cynosuretum in western river valleys. Where the watertable rises beside streams and pools, the Holco-Juncetum may form part of a complete or partial transition from grassland to swamp, fen or inundation communities. Here, as with the field mosaics, there may be a range of intermediate types of vegetation based on the abundance of the dominant Junci. The Holco-Juncetum commonly develops by the invasion of J. effusus and J. inflexus into established or newly-seeded grasslands. A number of studies have demonstrated that J. effusus produces formidable quantities of seed (Chippindale & Milton 1934, Milton 1936, 1948, Moore & Burr 1948, Salisbury 1964) and that these are readily dispersed by wind, by animals and farm machinery after the seed-coat becomes mucilaginous, NARDO-GALION CYNOSURION MESOBROMIONFigure 10.

However, two conditions must be fulfilled for germination and survival of the seedlings: light and soil surface humidity (Moore & Burr 1948, Lazenby 1955«, b, Agnew 1961). Successful invasion is therefore most readily achieved in a broken or badly-seeded sward where the soil surface does not dry out, conditions which are often met in over-grazed and poached pasture or on ill-drained land that is being put down to leys. Once established, the Holco-Juncetum is not readily eradicated. Grazing alone will not reduce the cover of J. effusus or J. inflexus and both are relatively tolerant of mowing. Systematic drainage, re-seeding and fertilising probably convert the community to the Lolium-Alope-curus-Festuca flood-pasture or Lolio-Cynosuretum but careful pastoral management is necessary to prevent re infestation. Ungrazed stands may be invaded by shrubs and trees tolerant of wet soils and eventually be con verted to scrub and woodland. Distribution "
"mg11","Zonation and succession Zonations involving the community most frequently reflect patterns of soil moisture and, on salt-marshes, the frequency of inundation of salt-laden water. Inland stands of the Lolium sub-community are frequently rather uniform but, where this vegetation occurs patchily in less well-managed grasslands, it grades, on drier ground, to some form of pasture, such as the Lolio-Cynosuretum or the Lolium-Alopecurus-Festuca community, and, around open water, to the Agrostis stolonifera-Alopecurus geniculatus grassland or to more open inundation communities. Salt-marsh stands of the Lolium sub-community and the Atriplex sub-community often pass down-marsh to some form of the Juncus maritimus community or Juncetum gerardi (such as the Leontodon sub-community or its derivatives). Secondary successions to the latter can sometimes be seen in turf-cuttings in the upper marsh which may be quickly colonised by P. anserina and have temporary stands of the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla community. Up-marsh, zonations are fre quently terminated artificially by a sea-wall or bank but the community sometimes grades to a less frequently inundated form of pasture, free of halophytes. Similarly, the Honkenya sub-community may form a transition zone between more unstable and halophytic strandline or shingle vegetation and essentially inland grassland. Festuca arundinacea is a sometimes conspicuous occasional in the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla community and probably increases its cover with a relaxation of grazing. Zonations between this community and the Potentillo-Festucetum arundinaceae may therefore be a reflection of successions between these two vegetation types mediated by changes in pasturing intensity. Distribution "
"mg12","Zonation and succession The Lolium-Holcus sub-community generally shows abrupt zonations to other vegetation types, sharpened by treatment where stands abut on to agricultural land or by sudden topographic differences where stands lie on steep banks alongside ditches. Occasionally, there are more gradual zonations to the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla community with increased grazing pressure or, on the upper salt-marsh, to the Oenanthe sub-community on more saline soils. Although this latter sub-community sometimes occurs as extensive pure stands, it is frequently encountered in a mosaic with some form of Juncus maritimus salt-marsh which replaces it on more frequently submerged ground.Distribution "
"mg13","Zonation and succession Small stands commonly form part of the often fragmentary sequences of communities which develop around fluctuating open waters in relation to frequency of inundation and the amount of disturbance by sediment movement and trampling. A frequent pattern is for an intact pasture sward (such as the typical variant of the typical sub-community of the Lolio-Cynosuretum) to give way through an intermediate (the A. geniculatus variant of the same vegetation) to the Agrostis-Alopecurus community on puddled soil around a pool or stream that is used by stock for watering. On moister silts which are more frequently inundated, this in turn may pass to more ephemeral inundation vegetation or to the Glycerietum fluitantis or related assemblages in the Glycerio-Sparganion. In washlands, the community occurs in mosaics with the Glycerietum fluitantis, the Festuca rubra-Agrostis stolonifera-Potentilla anserina inundation grassland and, around dykes, the Phalaridetum arundinaceae and Glycerietum maximae. Where the community occurs around areas of freshwater seepage on the upper salt-marsh, it may pass to more halophytic vegetation types in which A. stolonifera remains prominent. https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press104 Mesotrophic grasslands Distribution "
"mg2","Zonation and succession Spatial transitions between the Filipendulo-Arrhenatheretum and other vegetation types are partly controlled by the sharpness of local topographic discontinuities. Stands are often small and fragmentary and confined to ledges and embayments, giving way abruptly on less sheltered, sunnier slopes to the local form of calcicolous grassland. Where the vegetation is open to stock, graz ing may blur the zonation. There is sometimes a gradation to mixed deciduous woodland of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis or Fraxi-nus-Sorbus-Mecurialis types. However, although many sites may formerly have had a more extensive local woodland cover, the broken terrain on which the community is typically found could never have been densely wooded (Pigott 1958). The Filipendulo-Arrhenatheretum should therefore be regarded as a persistent woodland margin community rather than a serai pre cursor. The occasional association of the community with old mixed hedgerows is interesting in this respect. Distribution "
"mg3","Zonation and succession Stands of the Anthoxanthum-Geranium community occur most frequently in fields bounded by walls or fences and each subject to a more or less uniform treatment regime. Spatial zonations between the sub communities are therefore infrequent, although neg lected corners and margins of fields with either the Briza or the Bromus sub-community may show a narrow transition to the Arrhenatherum sub-community. The blue-violet flowers of Geranium pratense often mark out this sub-community in summer. On verges which have a less systematic treatment such transitions are more common and irregular. The local appearance of mire species in stands of the Anthoxanthum-Geranium community may form part of a transition to flush vegetation where drainage of soil water is strongly impeded. The types of mire involved in such sequences depend on the calcium status and pH of the ground water and include the Pinguiculo-Caricetum and the Molinia-Crepis fen. Along stream sides where there is seasonal inundation a tall-herb Filipendulion mire may terminate the sequence. The striking floristic similarity between the Anthoxanthum-Geranium community and the field layer of open stands of the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis and Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodlands strongly suggests that this meadow vegetation has developed by canopy clearance and is maintained by annual mowing which excludes tall dominants (Pigott 1956a, Bradshaw 1962). Zonations between the community and such woodland are rare but occasionally the two vegetation types occur contiguously on identical sites separated only by a boundary wall. In Scandinavia, very similar meadow vegetation is mown in the clearings of such open woodland (Nordhagen 1928, Sjörs 1954; see 'Affinities' below). Traditional treatment has maintained the community in all its richness but the vegetation of the Bromus sub community represents one stage in a process of increasing the productivity and decreasing the floristic diversity of hay-meadows in response to various combinations of fertiliser application, ploughing and re-seeding. This seems eventually to convert the vegetation to the Hol-cus-Trifolium sub-community of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland or the Anthoxanthum sub-community of the Lolio-Cynosuretum. Distribution "
"mg4","Zonation and succession Stands of the community frequently show considerable variation in the abundance of particular species. Some of this is related to the distinctive bushy (e.g. S. officinalis and F. ulmaria) or tussock (e.g. larger grasses) habit of certain components but local variations in treatment, such as differences in mowing-time, continued over long periods, may also have an effect (Ratcliffe 1977). Zonations to other communities are most frequently related to differences in soil moisture status. Damp hollows in meadows sometimes show gradations to the Holcus lanatus-Deschampsia cespitosa community or to the Holco-Juncetum, especially the Juncus inflexus sub community on more base-rich soils. These in turn may give way to Carex acutiformis swamp. Sharper zonations of this kind can sometimes be seen bordering the older drainage ditches which frequently traverse the meadows or in such places there may be an abrupt switch to the Agrostis stolonifer a-Alopecurus geniculatus inundation grassland. Modern ditches around the mea dows often have linear stands of Salix spp. or Alnus on their banks. Changes in treatment practice can alter the composition of the Alopecurus-Sanguisorba community and may initiate successions to other grassland types. An extension of grazing into the spring reduces the abundance of some of the most distinctive species of the community such as Sanguisorba officinalis, Silaum silaus and Fritillaria meleagris, all of which are highly pala table. This is the major community in Britain for F. meleagris and, if grazing is continued into its flowering period in late April to early May, it cannot set seed. At Marston Meadows in Staffordshire, a change from mowing to late spring grazing over the last 20 years has extensively reduced its cover (Ratcliffe 1977). It can, however, remain dormant in the soil for a number of years and seems able to recolonise fields from margins or ditch edges. If stands are ungrazed over the winter months, coarse grasses such as Arrhenatherum elatius (in drier places) and Deschampsia cespitosa (in wetter areas) may expand and eventually form stands of the Arrhenatheretum or the Holcus lanatus-Deschampsia cespitosa community. Drainage, ploughing, re-seeding or the addition of artificial fertilisers can all have a more drastic effect on the vegetation. Combined with an increase in grazing, such changes probably convert the community to the Lolium perenne-Alopecurus pratensis-Festuca pratensis flood-pasture or to the Lolio-Cynosuretum. Distribution "
"mg5","Zonation and succession Zonations in the Centaureo-Cynosuretum are usually related to edaphic patterns and, even in enclosed fields subject to a uniform treatment, there may be soil differences which reflect heterogeneities in the parent material. Within the Galium sub-community, an increase in Mesobromion species (such as Koeleria macrantha and Sanguisorba minor) is often related to a rise in calcium content and pH as the soil thins towards limestone exposures. Such patterns are commonly part of a com plete transition from the Centaureo-Cynosuretum to calcicolous grassland on the Carboniferous Limestone of the Yorkshire Dales where meadows on till or head abut on to, or surround, rocky outcrops (cf. Ivimey-Cook & Proctor 1966b on comparable zonations in The Burren). In a similar fashion, there may be an increase of species typical of calcifugous grasslands and heaths in the Danthonia sub-community where its characteristic brown earths grade to rankers or podzolised soils over siliceous material. The patchy occurrence of Juncus spp. or F. ulmaria within stands of the Centaureo-Cynosuretum represents truncated zonations to the Holco-Juncetum or Filipen-dulion mires which are mediated by the soil moisture status. Such patterns are a common feature of meadows on undulating topography and frequently accentuate ridge-and-furrow with fragmentary strips of F. ulmaria or Juncus spp. on the less well-drained soils of the furrows. Alongside streams there may be a more com plete gradation to poor-fen vegetation. Occasionally, differences in treatment may be evident as zonations within enclosed meadows as, for example, where narrow belts of rich Centaureo-Cynosuretum remain on steeper banks within fields or around margins which have escaped improvement. Generally, however, differences in treatment style have a gradual succession-al effect upon the community which is evident in a range of intermediates between the Centaureo-Cynosuretum and more improved and productive grassland types. Two changes of practice are of particular importance. The first is an increase of grazing pressure. Growth starts quite early in the regions where the community occurs and stands may provide a valuable supplementary bite towards the end of April. If grazing is continued into the summer, and especially if it is heavy, there is an eventual decrease in the richness of the sward. Early-flowering species such as Orchis morio are then unable to https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressMG5 Centaureo-Cynosuretum cristati grassland 63 set seed and there is a gradual expansion of rosette hemicryptophytes. The occurrence of the poisonous Colchicum autumnale in stands of the community has sometimes led to their being set aside for hay but some farmers have destroyed this species so as to allow an expansion of grazing. In fact, C. autumnale is more toxic during the early part of the season than in summer (Butcher 1954). Frequent mowing of the community, as occurs in some churchyards and on some verges and lawns, appears to have a similar effect to an increase in grazing. Although such treatment may permit the survival of an impoverished form of the Centaureo-Cynosuretum, the trend is for the sward to be converted eventually to the Lolio-Cynosuretum. This change may be further encouraged by the second, now very widespread, alteration in treatment. This is the replacement of the traditional farmyard manure by artificial mineral fertilisers. These enhance the growth of the grasses to the detriment of the dicotyledons. Lotus corniculatus and Leontodon hispidus are often the first species to be lost from the vegetation but a much greater impoverishment accompanies the rise in productivity in the long term. More drastic treatments of the community involve ploughing or the use of total weedkillers such as paraquat and re-seeding to produce Lolio-Cynosuretum or various kinds of ley. Such artificial successions to pasture depend ulti mately on the maintenance of grazing. When the Cen taureo-Cynosuretum or its derivatives are ungrazed, there is an expansion of coarser grasses and an eventual invasion of shrubs. The Lathyrus and Galium sub communities seem to progress to various types of Arrhenatheretum or, on more calcareous soils, to one of the coarser Mesobromion swards. The exact nature of the succession may also be influenced by the fertiliser regime on the original meadow. Ungrazed stands of the Dan thonia sub-community may be directly invaded by heath shrubs or Ulex europeaus. The results of careless grazing are sometimes evident as mosaics of Centaureo-Cynosuretum with patches of coarse grassland or heath. Distribution "
"mg6","Zonation and succession The application of careful uniform treatment within enclosed pasture stands of the Lolio-Cynosuretum tends to minimise the occurrence of zonations. However, where past improvement has been uneven, transitions may remain. Steeper banks inaccessible to ploughing may still carry patches of Centaureo-Cynosuretum as remnants of previous meadow vegetation. Hollows resistant to drainage may have the Holcus-Deschampsia community or Holco-Juncetum', the Deschampsia and Iris variants of the Typical sub-community can be seen as truncated zonations to such vegetation which occur where drainage is less successful. Where rivers and pools are not embanked, the Alopecurus geniculatus variant represents part of a transition to the vegetation of regularly-inundated water margins. Where pastures have been won from rocky upland topography, there may be zonations to calcifugous grasslands (with the Anthoxanthum sub-community) or calcicolous grasshttps://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.010 Published online by Cambridge University Press70 Mesotrophic grasslands lands (with the Trisetum sub-community) as the soil thins to some type of lithomorphic profile around outcrops. The Lolio-Cynosuretum can be derived from a very wide range of vegetation types (Figure 9) including, in extreme cases, communities of stabilised sand-dunes and blanket mire. Certain kinds of agricultural treatment or neglect may allow some of the more closely related types of original unimproved vegetation to replace the Lolio-Cynosuretum. In older pastures, a return to more traditional organic manuring and the withdrawal of summer grazing may permit the re establishment of the meadow vegetation of the Cen taureo-Cynosuretum. This is perhaps more likely in the Anthoxanthum and Trisetum sub-communities where certain meadow species persist or where there are frag ments of meadow-sward on banks or adjacent verges. Similarly, the choking of drains may permit the development of extensive Holco-Juncetum. Generally, however, successions involving the Lolio-Cynosuretum appear to be mediated by grazing. Under grazing allows coarser species to increase their cover and this is sometimes a prelude to the invasion and spread of Arrhenatherum elatius and the development of an Arrhenatheretum. Abandoned pasture often shows a patchy mosaic of the two communities with scattered saplings of Crataegus monogyna. Where grazing is too severe, the sward may be opened up for invasion by weeds and rabbit infestation may speed the run-down to some weed-dominated vegetation. Trampling may be an attendant problem with over-grazing by cattle but is especially important in recreational and amenity stands of the Lolio-Cynosuretum where heavy use along foot paths, around gateways and in goal-mouths may produce a succession to Lolio-Plantaginion vegetation.

"mg8","Zonation and succession Enclosed stands of the community in riverside pastures may be subject to uniform treatment and show no zonations to other vegetation types. In some cases, however, improvement and management have been restricted by difficult topography and an inability to prevent flooding. Here, and around the more fragmentary spring and flush stands, there may be zonations related to soil moisture conditions. A usual pattern is for the Cynosurus-Caltha community to give way to inundation communities on the bare substrates of river banks or pool-sides or to small-sedge mires of the Caricion davallianae in base-rich flushes. On drier ground, there may be a transition to the Lolium-Alope-curus-Festuca flood-pasture or, where there has been extensive improvement, directly to Lolio-Cynosuretum. Such a sequence can be seen on the drained levels of West Sedgemoor in Somerset. Artificial drainage can mediate a successional sequence from the Cynosurus-Caltha community to drier pasture types but neglect permits a fairly rapid invasion of Salix spp. and other shrubs and trees of wet woodland. Distribution "
"mg9","Zonation and succession The community occurs very frequently as part of zonations related to differences in soil moisture status. The Poa sub-community is common in moist hollows within https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.013 Published online by Cambridge University Press84 Mesotrophic grasslands pastures and on grazed verges where there is gleying and it commonly gives way, with a decrease in the cover of D. cespitosa, to Lolio-Cynosuretum or the Lolium-Alope-curus-Festuca community on better-drained soils. Around permanently wet hollows, pools and lakes, the community regularly forms part of an ecotone to some type of fen or swamp or, where there is a frequent rise and fall of water level, as around reservoirs, to a sequence of inundation communities. In many cases, it is possible to discern a range of intermediates between the Holcus-Deschampsia community and its neighbours and, in zonations to fen-meadows, there is, or has been in the past, the further complication of mowing and grazing effects. Such transitional swards may also figure in serai changes that ensue in badly-managed or abandoned pastures and meadows. Once established, D. cespitosa cannot be totally eradicated by continued grazing and, if drainage deteriorates, it will slowly spread to dominate in the Poa sub-community. Even where drainage is improved, preferential grazing of other species may prevent D. cespitosa being ousted by possible competitors. Where there is a reduction of grazing on better-drained land, the Arrhenatherum sub-community may develop from pasture swards. Although a switch to mowing is probably the best form of control of D. cespitosa (Davy 1980), the silting up of ditches within meadows may precipitate a spread of the community. If grazing continues, the Holcus-Deschampsia grassland is maintained as a plagioclimax and, even when it ceases, the densely-tussocky character of the vegetation often severely hinders any establishment of seedling shrubs and trees. Where succession to woodland does occur, it is usually to the Deschampsia sub-communities of the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia or Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodlands. Stands of the Holcus-Deschampsia grassland can often be found in rides and clearings in tracts of these kinds of woodlands or planted replacements of them in forests on heavy, clay soils with considerable continuity among the herb flora. In such situations, the Holcus-Deschampsia grassland can provide an important seed source for the spread of D. cespitosa beneath the trees when felling or coppicing increases the light.

"ov10","Zonation and succession In arable fields, the Poa-Senecio community can occur patchily within or around the crop, alone or with other Polygono-Chenopodion assemblages typical of cereals,roots or vegetables, the Polygonum-Matricaria or, mostly in the south-east, the Polygonum-Ranunculus sub-community being the typical forms here. In weedy leys or pastures, the Agrostis-Rumex sub-community often occurs among some Lolio-Plantagin-ion sward like the Lolio-Plantaginetum, sometimes with patches of Urtica-Cirsium vegetation. In very badly poached areas, these may give way to some sort of Bidention assemblage like the Polygonium-Poa commu-nity. Around drier gateways, there is often a sequence of Poly gonum-Chamomilla and Poa-Plantago assemblages. On slighter more acidic and less eutrophic soils, the Dactylis-Agrostis sub-community replaced the Agrostis-Rumex type. This sort of Poa-Senecio vegetation can also be seen with Lolium-DactyUs grassland on dis-turbed waysides and verges. Both P annua (Hutchinson & Seymour 1982) and S. vulgaris (Salisbury 1964) are able to complete their life cycle very quickly and, where conditions do not remaincongenial, this community can have but a fleeting exis-tence. In arable fields or seasonally-poached leys, it may return year after year but, where swards close, it is typi-cally replaced by some form of Lolio-Plantaginion vege-tation like the Lolium-Dacty Us community.

Continuing cultivation for growing arable crops creates suitable conditions for re-establishment of the community each year and sets back any tendency for succession. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.080 Published online by Cambridge University Press366 Vegetation of open habitats Distribution "

Patches of Urtica-Cirsium vegetation may also figure. Where the community occurs along paths, it can pass via patchy zones of the Polygonum-Chamomilla vegeta-tion to the Lolium-Dactylis grassland or mown recrea-tional swards of the Lolio-Plantaginion.

On more sandy and less base-rich soils in eastern Britain it can give way to the Urtica urens-Lamium community and, in the far south-west, to the Cerastium-Fumaria community.

"ov18","Zonation and succession The Polygonum-Chamomilla community occurs with other weed assemblages and grasslands around tracks and gateways in sequences of vegetation related to the intensity of disturbance and trampling. Often, the community occupies an intermediate posi-tion between the Poa-Plantago vegetation of the most heavily trampled situations and various pasture, ley or verge grasslands where treading is not so severe but where grazing or mowing maintain the sward. A widespread pattern is for this community to pass to the Lolio-Plan-taginetum on recreational swards and frequently cut verges, or to some Lolium ley or the Lolio-Cynosuretum in agricultural enclosures. On less frequently mown path edges, the Lolium-Dactylis grassland can figure or, on disturbed verge margins, the Poa-Taraxacum community. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.087 Published online by Cambridge University PressOV18 Polygonum aviculare-Chamomilla suaveolens community 385 More disturbed tracksides and gateways can also have the Poa-Senecio or Stellaria-Capsella communities, where species such as Senecio vulgaris, Stellaria media, Sinapis arvensis and Chenopodium album join Poa annua, Chamomilla suaveolens, Polygonum aviculare and Cap-sella bursa-pastoris as prominent elements of the flora. Some of these transitions also represent successional developments from the Polygonum-Chamomilla commu-nity with a reduction in trampling pressure. Such shifts can continue through the more grassy Lolium-Dactylis community or, with disturbance, through the weed com-munities of the Polygono-Chenopodion and Fumario-Euphorbion. Where disturbance ceases, progression to sub-scrub vegetation of the Rubus-Holcus type and then to Prunetalia scrub, is usual. Distribution "

"ov20","Zonation and succession The Sagino-Bryetum often occurs isolated from other vegetation types in urban streets and yards. Among care-fully kept stonework, only the Parietaria and Cymba-laria communities or Asplenium vegetation among wall cracks may accompany it to bring some touch of green to the built environment. With less assiduous street maintenance, the Poa-Taraxacum community is also often present down pavement edges and gross neglect brings other Polygonion and Lolio-Plantaginion assem-blages, as well as tall-herb weed communities. Among urban ruins, for example, or ancient monuments where there is still some trampling, the Sagino-Bryetum often gives way to the Poa-Plantago and Polygonum-Chamomilla communities in places where crevices are https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.089 Published online by Cambridge University PressOV20 Sagino-Bryetum argentii community 393 larger and soil accumulation more extensive.

The Typical sub-community, in its very narrow cracks, is more resistant to such invasion, though trees and shrubs may colonise directly and prise open cobbles and paving as their roots grow.

The latter may pass in turn to the Arrhenathetum on verges which receive one or two annual cuts. More frequently trimmed verge margins may have the Poa-Taraxacum community. The Poa-Plan-tago community is also found as a more abrupt intrusion among calcicolous, calcifuge, dune and cliff-top grass-lands, wherever heavy trampling along paths and around viewpoints disrupts and transforms the existing swards. Wetter tracks, ill-drained or periodically-flooded pas-tures often have the Poly gonum-Ranunculus sub-com-munity in trampled and poached places, giving way to the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla grassland where treading and disturbance are less severe.

On verges, too, away from the edge, the Poa-Taraxacum assemblage is replaced by Lolio-Plantaginion grasslands or, where management is not so assiduous, by the Lolium-DactyUs community.

Paths through stretches of this vegetation usually see a sharp transition through the Plantago-Trifolium sub-community to the Poa-Plantago community along the trampled strip (Figure 25). Where there is more exten-sive trampling, an intervening zone of Polygonum-Chamomilla vegetation can mark the areas with lighter Figure 25. Vegetation pattern on an ill-maintained urban street.

On verges or in recreation areas where this happens, the usual further stage is for Rubus-Holcus underscrub and Crataegus-Hedera scrub to develop. Similar mixtures of rank grasslands and woody vegetation can be found on wasteland and abandoned building sites where Lolium-Dactylis vegetation spreads on to spoil heaps. Distribution "
"ov24","Zonation and succession The Urtica-Galium community is found in very diverse patchworks and zonations with weed vegetation, meso-trophic grasslands, fens, scrub and woodland. It maygive way to woody vegetation in time but invasion of shrubs and trees can be greatly hindered by the dense habit of the dominant nettle. A common pattern seen on verges, waysides, neglected pastures and ill-managed recreational areas is for the Urtica-Galium community to occur patchily around dis-turbed places in stretches of Lolium-Dactylis grassland or among the Arrhenatheretum with stretches of Rubus-Holcus underscrub marking the progression to woody vegetation. In such situations, the more open Urtica-Cirsium community can also occur and there may be whole suites of weedy assemblages along pathways and around gateways. In wetter habitats, where the Urtica-Galium commu-nity has developed along streamsides or around ponds,lakes and fen systems, it can give way on drier ground to the Arrhenatheretum and towards open water to the Phragmites-Urtica fen with its characteristic patchy dominance of Urtica, Phragmites and Epilobium hirsu-tum. Stands of the Epilobium community or eutrophic swamps like the Typhetum latifoliae or Glycerietum maximae can also figure in such zonations, or on drier ground, the Alnus-Urtica woodland. This kind of forest is probably the ultimate successor of the Urtica-Galium community in this sort of habitat. Disturbance The Urtica-Galium community is ubiquitous through the lowlands, extending into the upland fringes wherever disturbance creates suitable conditions. Affinities More species-poor stands of tall-herb vegetation have sometimes created problems for adequate description and integration into phytosociological schemes, so certain authorities recognise so-called 'basal' syntaxalike the Urtica d/ozca-Gesellschaft of Mucina et al. (1993) which are allocated, not to any particular alli-ances, but more generally to a class. Of more precisely defined assemblages, the Urtica-Galium community comes closest, in the Arrhenatherum-Rubus sub-commu-nity, to the Urtico-Cruciatetum laevipedis Dierschke 1973 described from Germany (Oberdorfer 1983, Pott1992) and Austria (Mucina et al. 1993). Authorities differ as to whether this is better placed in the Galio-Alliarion (Oberdorfer 1957) Lohmeyer & Oberdorfer in Oberdorfer et al. 1967 or the Aegopodion podagrariae R.Tx. 1967. Certainly, with us, this is not usually a woodland fringe community, vegetation types fromwhich are grouped in the latter alliance. Whatever the choice, these two alliances are now separated off from the Artemisietea into a new class, the Galio-Urticetea Passarge & Kopecky 1967 which contains more eutrophic tall-herb and woodland fringe vegetation. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.093 Published online by Cambridge University Press408 Vegetation of open habitats Floristic table OV24 Urtica dioica Galium aparine Cirsium arvense Bromus sterilis Smymium olusatrum Veronica hederifolia Fumaria officinalis Allium triquetrum Myosotis arvensisRumex conglomerate Heracleum sphondyliumArrhenatherum elatius Taraxacum officinale agg.

"ov25","Zonation and succession The community occurs typically with other weed vegeta-tion or among various grasslands and scrub commu-nities. Invasion by brambles, shrubs and trees can continue or restore a succession to woodland. Among neglected, disturbed or ill-managed pastures and leys, this kind of vegetation can occur very fragmen-tarily around molehills and patches of broken ground, passing sharply to the Lolio-Cynosuretum or Lolio-Plantaginion leys. On grassy waysides and verges, stands can be larger and the context is usually communities likethe Lolium-Dactylis assemblage or the Arrhenatheretum. Along road edges, it can give way to the Poa-Matricaria perforata community. On wasteland, the Urtica-Cirsium community can occur with a variety of other weed vegetation like the Matricaria perforata-Stellaria or Stellaria-Capsella assemblages, in various sub-communities of which both stinging nettle and thistles can remain prominent. Such vegetation types can precede the development of the Urtica-Cirsium community on abandoned arable land or waste ground. Subsequent stages in succession can be seen where ground remains undisturbed or unmanaged. Then, Rubus fruticosus agg. can become more patchily prominent among the Urtica-Cirsium vegetation,thicken up into Rubus-Holcus underscrub and this in turn progress to Crataegus-Hedera scrub. Mosaics of such communities are a common feature of abandoned waste ground and grossly-disturbed woodland clearings and margins. Eventual development of Quercus-Pterid-ium-Rubus or Fagus-Rubus woodland is the likely culmi-nation of such succession on the kind of soils where the Urtica-Cirsium community occurs. Distribution "
"ov26","Zonation and succession The Epilobium hirsutum community occurs in swamps, fens, woodlands and mesotrophic grasslands in zona-tions and mosaics that are determined by the position of the ground water table and the occurrence of grazing or mowing. A common sequence around open waters is for the community to occur behind some kind of tall-herb fen, like the Phragmites-Eupatorium fen or, in more generally eutrophic systems, the Phragmites-Urtica fen. With the latter, it can be difficult to draw the bounds between each community because patchy dominance of E. hirsutumand Urtica, along with Phragmites, is typical of the fen, and reed may run on with local prominence into the Epi-lobium vegetation. More abrupt sequences, where there is a sudden shift to wetter ground, as on steep ditch sides, can see the Epi-lobium community giving way directly to the Phragmite-tum, Glycerietum, Caricetum paniculatae, Caricetum ripariae, or Typhetum latifoliae swamps. Along streams where stock or people have access or on canal margins, such patterns may be very fragmentary because of tram-pling or bank erosion. Towards drier ground in these systems, the Epilobium community can give way to the Arrhenatheretum and these two vegetation types can also occur together on verges, the Filpendula-Angelica sub-community of the Epilobium vegetation being in common in ditches along roadsides. This sub-community is also widespread on river ter-races and in wet meadows where it often occurs with the Filipendula-Angelica mire, E. hirsutum persisting some distance into the fen as dominance shifts to the meadow-sweet. Where such systems are grazed and especially where the soils are not so free-draining, the Juncus-Cirsium community or Holco-Juncetum tends to replace the Filipendula-Angelica fen and, where the Epilobium vegetation persists, it is usually of the Juncus-Ranuncu-lus type. Woodlands of various kinds can be found as part of these sequences, particularly the Salix-Betula-Phrag-mites woodland and Alnus-Carex woodland in more intact fens and streamsides, the Alnus-Urtica woodland in eutrophicated fens and in mature river valleys with alluvial terraces. However, the shade sensitivity of E. hir-sutum means transitions to the Epilobium community are typically very abrupt. The community is probably expanding its cover in fens with increased eutrophication of ground waters and sed-iments and, once established, it is probably fairly stable:it is not really an element in active hydroseres. With con-tinued drying, however, it might be expected to progress eventually to some kind of Alnus-Urtica woodland. Distribution "
"ov27","Zonation and succession Very commonly, stands of E. angustifolium vegetation are sharply marked off from their surrounds by the highly localised disturbance that has resulted in their development. In oak-birch woodlands, for example, stands of the Rubus-Dryopteris sub-community often occupy much of small open areas created by clearance of fire, or those places where burning of brashings or coppice waste has been concentrated, surrounded by surviving areas of https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.096 Published online by Cambridge University PressOV27 Epilobium angustifolium community 421 Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus, Quercus-Betula-Oxalis, or Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodlands or coniferised replacements. Sometimes, Rubus-Pteridium or Rubus-Holcus underscrubs also occur with the willow-herb where bramble or bracken have gained ascendancy or else patches of Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland on parched or grazed areas. Heathy woodlands where burning has occurred sometimes have both the Rubus-Dryopteris and the Holcus-Festuca sub-communities. On unwooded heaths, the latter type of E. angustifolium vegetation usually marks out old burns among Calluna-Festuca, Calluna-Ulex minor, Calluna-Ulex gallii and Calluna-Erica cinerea heaths. Ulex-Rubus scrub can also develop around disturbed and burned areas and, on grazed heaths, Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex and Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grasslands can also form part of the patchwork. The Acer-Sambucus sub-community is also commonly seen in woodlands, in this case the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis or Fagus-Mercurialis types, marking out old bonfire sites. In larger clearings where trees andshrubs are slower to re-establish themselves, Deschamp-sia-Holcus grassland is a common associate, with Crataegus-Hedera scrub where shrub colonisation is occurring. The Urtica-Cirsium sub-community is often seen among disturbed or burned stretches of Arrhenathere-tum or Deschampsia-Holcus grassland, often with stands of Urtica-Galium and Urtica-Cirsium vegetation. The Ammophila sub-community occurs locally among Ammophila-Festuca, Festuca-Galium and Ammophila-Arrhenatherum grasslands where dunes have been burned and disturbed. Sometimes, Hippophae scrub also occurs in such situations. E. angustifolium is a formidable competitor to smaller herbs and seedling trees and shrubs but woody plants can eventually overtop the willow-herb where they have established in more open places or where they resprout from substantial cut stools. The particular kind of woodland succeeding the E. angustifolium vegetation will depend on the local soil and climatic conditions and the availability of colonisers, but the range of commu-nities noted above may all eventually replace stands ofwillow-herb according to particular circumstances. On more mesotrophic or calcareous soils, Crataegus-Hedera or Prunus scrub may supervene. On sandy soils, resump-tion of judicious burning or grazing may reinstate some kind of heath rather than acidophilous oak-birch wood-land. Distribution "
"ov28","Zonation and succession Around wet areas in pastures, on flood-plains and away from river banks, the Agrostio-Ranunculetum can give way to the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla grassland or some kind of Lolium ley, with the Poa-Plantago community sometimes figuring as an intermediate or, where drier ground is trampled, the Polygonum-Chamomilla assem-blage. In sluggish streams or watering places, the Agrostis-Alopecurus community can figure. In wet arable fields, the Agrostio-Ranunculetum can pass to the Poa-Plantago or Matricaria-Stellaria community. On river shoals and silty margins of water-courses, the community can be found in mosaics and zonations with the Ranunculo-Alopecuretum, the Polygono-Bidentetum, the Polygonum-Poa community and the Rorippa-Filaginella community, sometimes also with patches of Phalaridetum.

Distribution "
"ov29","Zonation and succession On expanses of sediment laid totally bare by flooding and then exposed on river islands and margins, the Ranunculo-Alopecuretum can develop patchily, either alone or with other inundation communities, their dis-position related in part to the texture and wetness of the sediments, though often with an element of chance about which assemblages colonise where (Figure 26). Such patterns also vary considerably from year to year according to the extent and character of the material once more flooded and exposed: Tuxen (in Ellenberg 1988) very aptly compared this variation to the squeez-ing and release of an accordion. Very often, the Agrostio-Ranunculetum is also involved in such patterns and each of the communities can pass to the Polygono-Bidentetum or Polygonum-Poa community with an increase in abundance of Bidens and Polygonum spp. These latter two assemblages are perhaps more common where silts prevail among the sediments. On muds which remain wetter longer, the Rorippa-Filago community can figure and, where the water table stays close to the surface all summer, the Polygonum amphi-bium community. Patchily on river islands, sometimes more extensively along banks and towards the limit of fluctuation around reservoirs, the Phalaridetum arundin-aceae may occur with the Ranunculo-Alopecuretum. Another very common situation for this community is in low-lying stretches of flood-plain pastures which are inundated in winter. Then, the Ranunculo-Alopecuretum usually gives way on less flooded ground where there has not been too much agricultural improvement to the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla grassland.

"ov30","Zonation and succession The Polygono-Bidentetum is typically a patchy element of zonations around fluctuating open waters where shifts in composition and structure of the vegetation are related to duration and depth of inundation. Quite commonly, this community gives way, on silts and clays subject to longer inundation, to the Rorippa-Filaginella community where Bidens remains quite common but where dominance usually passes to various annual knotweeds with Rorippa palustris and Filaginella uliginosa becoming more frequent. Upslope, at and beyond the limits of inundation, the community can give way to a zone of the Phalaridetum arundinaceae.

"ov32","Zonation and succession The Ranunculetum scelerati is generally found as small, often fragmentary stands in mosaics and zonations with other inundation vegetation, water-margin communities and wet grasslands, the patterns being related to the extent of inundation, disturbance and enrichment. Where dunging or other forms of eutrophication are absent or very localised around ponds and alongside streams, the community can give way to Rorippa-Filaginella vegetation on somewhat less fertile, periodi-cally-inundated ground. At the water's edge, it frequently gives way to Glycerio-Sparganion assem-blages like the Glycerietum fluitantis or stands domi-nated by Nasturtium officinale agg. or Veronica beccabunga, among which plants like Myosotis scorpi-oides, Alisma plantago-aquatica and Berula erecta can remain locally prominent. Ragged zonations between these mixtures of plants are very common along small lowland streams and ditches through silty and clay soils. In other situations, the Ranunculetum scelerati can pass more directly to swamps like the Glycerietum maximae or to periodically inundated Elymo-Rumicion swards or damp Lolio-Plantaginion leys. Distribution "
"ov33","Zonation and succession Typically, the Polygonum-Poa community occurs on the wettest ground among patchworks of other kinds of weed vegetation, leys and pasture swards on farmland, recreation areas and along tracks. Usually, it is the degree of wetness, disturbance and trampling which influences the character and disposi-tion of these assemblages. Where the ground is some-what drier but still trampled, the Polygonum-Poa community often gives way to some kind of Polygonion avicularis vegetation like the Polygonum-Chamomilla and Poa-Plantago major communities where P. aviculare and Poa annua remain constant but where the otherannual knotweeds fade in importance. This can then pass to Lolio-Plantaginion swards where more trample-resistant plants remain common within a more extensive grassy matrix. Similar sequences to this develop where ill-sown leys are subject to much poaching in wet spring weather. If irregular disturbance of damp, eutrophic soils remains a feature, as where farm vehicles churn up the ground, Polygono-Chenopodion communities canreplace the Polygonum-Poa vegetation as with the Poa-Senecio or Poa-Myosotis communities. Where disturbance or trampling of such habitats ceases, the Polygonum-Poa community is usuallyreplaced by less ephemeral Polygono-Chenopodion weed vegetation, then by eutrophic tall-herb stands of the Artemisietea, usually dominated by Urtica dioica and large Cirsium spp. Disturbance This community is very common in suitable habitats throughout the lowlands. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.102 Published online by Cambridge University PressOV33 Polygonum lapathifolium-Poa annua community 437 Affinities The Polygonum-Poa community contains those stands of ephemeral vegetation in which various species of Polygonum are prominent in the absence of Bidens tri-partita.

"ov34","Zonation and succession The Allium-Plantago community is found most com-monly among stands of the Erica-Ulex heath on The Lizard in situations where the serpentine soils become shallow in rocky ground on the plateaus, on valley sides and in transitions to cliff-tops. In such places the ericoid sub-shrubs and gorse become confined to deeper pockets of soil within cre-vices among the serpentine, are held in check by the shortage of ground water and occasionally killed by severe drought (Hopkins 1983). The consequent lack ofshade and access of stock and rabbits to the sward also help maintain the short and species-rich characteristic of the Festuca sub-community of the Erica-Ulex heath. Here, F. ovina, Thymus praecox, Koeleria macrantha, Scilla verna and Plantago maritima become more common among the heath flora and it is such plants which, together with sparse Calluna, extend a little way into the pans among the rock exposures where theAllium-Plantago community develops. Closer to cliff-tops, as maritime influence increases, the Erica-Ulex heath gives way to the Calluna-Scilla heath, the Viola sub-community of which shares many associates with the grassy form of the inland heath. The Allium-Plantago community can sometimes be found in such transitions but it does not extend far on to the sea-cliffs. Distribution "
"ov35","Zonation and succession The Ly thrum-Ranunculus community is sometimes found with inundation communities like the Agrostio-Ranunculetum or Polygono-Bidentetum on periodically-flooded silts around pools and lakes or among the Holco-Juncetum in wet pastures on impeded soils. Towards shallow open waters, it can give way to the Ele-ocharitetumpalustris or Callitriche vegetation. Repeated flooding helps maintain suitable habitats for the commu-nity and drainage leads to succession to wet grassland or rush pasture. Distribution "
"ov36","Zonation and succession The stands of the Ly thrum-Juncus community are char-acteristically clearly marked off from their intensively arable context. By August, as Preston & Whitehouse(1986) vividly describe the sight, they are picked out as pink islands, coloured by the flowers of Polygonumpersi-caria, among the golden ripening cereals. Without the disturbance necessary for its reappear-ance, however, the community is rapidly overtaken by Polygono-Chenopodion vegetation with an increasing perennial element (as in the Elymus-Potentilla sub-com-munity of the Matricaria-Stellaria community) or by tall-herb vegetation of the Artemisietea, where species like Epilobium hirsutum dominate. One long-unculti-vated hollow noted by Preston & Whitehouse (1986) had progressed to Salix atrocinerea scrub. Distribution "
"ov37","Zonation and succession The usual context of the Minuartio-Thlaspietum is among grasslands and heaths, any transitions to whichare mediated by differences in soils. In fact, quite often, stands of the community are rather sharply marked off from the grasslands around. At lower altitudes, in the Mendips and Derbyshire, these grasslands are usually of the Festuca-Avenula type, most often the Dicranum sub-community or, where there has been some improvement for agriculture, the Holcus-Tri-folium sub-community. Where soils change more gradu-ally, Typical Minuartio-Thlaspietum may give way to the Mesobromion pastures through the Achillea-Euphrasia sub-community. In other places, the latter vegetation passes to a Cynosurion sward, usually the Lolio-Cyno-sure turn, derived by fertilising and often ploughing and reseeding. Where soils are somewhat less calcareous, as where superficial overlie the limestone, the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland can figure among the pas-tures around the lead-mine spoil or, where grazing has not been so heavy, heath vegetation. In the Mendips,where this situation is more common, this is generally Calluna-Ulex gallii heath. At higher altitudes over most of the Yorkshire Dales, the calcicolous pasture is of the Sesleria-Galium type. The Typical sub-community of this grassland can pass sharply to Typical Minuartio-Thlaspietum or the Clado-nia sub-community or, more gradually, through the Achillea-Euphrasia sub-community. Elsewhere, on somewhat more acidic soils, the Sesleria-Galium grass-land can be replaced by the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland or, where grazing has not been so intensive, by grassy forms of Calluna-Vaccinium heath. Where succession has proceeded further around old lead mines, the Minuartio-Thlaspietum may be closely hemmed in by Crataegus-Hedera scrub and Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland at lower altitudes or by https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.106 Published online by Cambridge University Press448 Vegetation of open habitats Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis on higher ground to the north. The character of the soils supporting the Minuar-tio-Thlaspietum itself is generally inimical to colonisa-tion by shrubs and trees, but relief from grazing may have some effect on the vegetation in the long term. Distribution "
"ov38","Zonation and succession The Gymno carpietum typically occurs among patch-works of grassland, scrub and woodland on colonising screes and rocky limestone slopes. This vegetation often appears to be a colonising com-munity on coarser limestone talus and, where grazing is absent, it can be overtaken by invasion of woody plants. Typically, over the warmer and drier limestones of south-ern England and Wales, the kind of woodland which develops in such situations is the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercuri-alis woodland. The eventual dominants of this commu-nity can include Fraxinus, Ulmus glabra, Acer pseudoplatanus, A. campestre and Quercus robus with often a rich understorey of shrubs among which Corylus avellana and Crataegus monogyna figure prominently. However, early stages in the development of this kind of woodland, and of the Crataegus-Hedera scrub which often precedes it, are quite diverse and strongly depen-dent on which seed-parents are available locally and also on the particular terrain conditions (Merton 1970). Various forms of this scrub and woodland can therefore be found in close association with the Gymno car pietum, species like Geranium robertianum, Mercurialis perennis, Mycelis muralis and Viola riviniana running on with undiminished frequency and often in some abundance under the shrubs and trees. With increasing shade,however, the two dominants of the fern community are quickly overwhelmed by the closing canopy. The various elements in this kind of pattern survive best on sunnier slopes with coarser talus and rocky outcrops where woodland development is more patchy. In some such situations, the fern community grows among the distinc-tive Teucrium sub-community of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland (cf. Oberdorfer 1977). Where talus becomes finer and surrounding slopes sustain calcicolous pasture to which stock have access, the sward is typically of the Festuca-Avenula type but this is characteristically sharply marked off from the fern stands on the coarser scree. One further element in the mosaics can be provided by the Asplenietum which replaces the Gymno car pietum on limestone exposures with smaller crevices. A variety of bryophytes occur in both assemblages. In the Yorkshire Dales, where the climate is somewhat cooler and moister away from sunny south-facing slopes, the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland is replaced in such sequences by the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland and the Festuca-Avenula grassland by the Ses-leria-Galium grassland. In many of its localities, the Gymno car pietum should probably be seen as a secondary colonising community following woodland clearance. Where it becomes sur-rounded by subsequent regrowth of scrub or where thetalus is especially coarse, this vegetation may benefit from the protection from grazing and persist for some time. Distribution "
"ov39","Zonation and succession In its natural habitats, the Asplenietum is found on rocky habitats among other fern and bryophyte communities, calcicolous grasslands, scrub and woodland where zona-tions and successions are related to the extent of soil development, the degree of exposure to light and wind and the intensity of grazing. Stands in artificial habitatsare often more isolated but can sometimes be found with other fern, bryophyte or crevice vegetation depending on the amount of shelter and shade. Many of the floristic and structural differences https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.108 Published online by Cambridge University PressOV39 Asplenietum trichomano-rutae-murariae community 455 between the two sub-communities of the Asplenietum are related to the extent of soil formation and colonisa-tion by vascular plants over limestone outcrops. Quite often, the Sedum-Arenaria sub-community is transi-tional between the Trichostomum-Tortula sub-commu-nity and some kind of calcicolous grassland on less rocky slopes around. There, more extensive, deeper and somewhat less drought-prone soils are often also access-ible to grazing stock which cannot reach the craggier ground. Over much of the range of this fern vegetation in southern Britain, the typical calcicolous pasture swards are the Festuca-Avenula grassland and, in the warmer south and east, its analogues dominated by Bromus erectus and Brachypodium pinnatum. In fact, where the harder Carboniferous and Devonian lime-stones that provide some of the most congenial sub-strates for this community crop out, it is usually the Dicranum sub-community of Festuca-Avenula grassland that forms the bulk of the pasture on rendziniform soils of gentler slopes. In the Mendips, Derbyshire Dales and in north and south Wales, transitions to such grasslandinvolve a rapid loss of the fern and much of the bryo-phyte contingent and a rise in the extent and number ofperennial vascular calcicoles in the vegetation. Someephemerals may continue to find a place on scuffed areas of sward but in general most are scarce. On the Carbo-niferous Limestone around Morecambe Bay and in the Yorkshire Dales, the Sesleria-Galium grassland replaces the Festuca-Avenula grassland in such sequences while on local limestone exposures through Scotland, the community can be found among stands of Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland. On the Durness Limestone of Skye, this Asplenietum occurs in crevices in close asso-ciation with the Dryas-Carex heath. More locally, the Asplenietum can be found in associa-tion with the Festuca-Carlina grassland on limestone cliffs around the south-western seaboard of Britain but in the very hot and sunny conditions characteristic of such situations in summer, the fern vegetation often extends only on to somewhat shaded rock surfacesnearby. In more inland habitats, where the surrounds to rock outcrops are not grazed, the Asplenietum may be moreisolated among scrub and woodland. Usually, on thelimestones characteristic of this fern vegetation, this is Crataegus-Hedera scrub or Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland. Most of the shrubs and trees of these com-munities show limited ability to colonise rockier ground where soils are very limited so they peter out around the crags in a more open cover of stunted individuals. However, they may cast some shade on the Asplenietum which can be inimical to its survival. Where rocky crags occur close to gardens, colonisation of the crevices themselves with Cotoneaster and Berber is spp. can be extensive and this can shade out the community com-pletely. Where deeper crevices in limestone outcrops get more shade and shelter, the Asplenietum can give way to the Asplenio-Cystopteridetum or, in grikes, to fragmentary stands of minituarised woodland. On walls and build-ings where mortar-filled vegetation crevices provide thehabitat for this the Trichostomum-Tor tula sub-commu-nity can be found in close association with the Parieta-rietum and Cymbalarietum communities. Distribution "
"ov4","Zonation and succession The Spergulo-Chrysanthemetum occurs patchily within and around the edges of arable fields, sometimes giving way to other weed assemblages where there are local shifts in soil conditions, or differences in treatments and crops. In fields on clayey soils in the south-west and in Wales, for example, it tends to be replaced by the Poa annua-Stachys arvensis community and among summer cereals by the Papaveretum. More heavily fertilised or herbicide-treated stretches of crop or fields can see a switch to communities like Matriciaria-Stellaria assem-blage. With the move to the more extreme oceanic climate of the far south-west of England, the Spergulo-Chrysanthemetum is replaced by the Cerastium-Fumaria community on similar soils. Continuing cultivation of arable crops repeatedly creates congenial conditions for the community but tra-ditional alternations of cereals or roots and fallow grass-land, as on the machair of the Outer Hebrides, leads to a temporary successional replacement of the Ranunculus repens sub-community by swards of the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla or Festuca-Galium types (I. Craw-ford, personal communication). Distribution "
"ov40","Zonation and succession On shaded rock outcrops in mountains, the Asplenio-Cystopteridetum can often be found growing as isolated fragments in crevices. Where on exposures at higher alti-tudes there is more opportunity for soil accumulation and where seepage keeps the cliff faces dripping wet, the community can be found with the Saxifraga-Alchemilla vegetation, the asplenoid ferns continuing to figure occasionally among the luxuriant herb carpet of that assemblage. On drier ledges and crags, the Dryas-Silene community can also figure, with the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland usually occurring over the grazed slopes around. In the Yorkshire Dales, at somewhat lower altitudes on Carboniferous Limestone, the Asple-nio-Cystopterideturn occurs on crags among the Sesle-ria-Galium grassland and can be seen in the mosaics of vegetation among high level grikes on pavement expo-sures. In sunnier situations at lower altitudes, the com-munity is replaced by the Asplenietum. Distribution "
"ov41","Zonation and succession Where walls have smaller crevices in mortar, the Parieta-rietum can be found with the Cymbalarietum and Asple-nietum communities, where dominance shifts to Cymbalaria or small ferns. In fact, Segal (1969) saw A. ruta-muraria and Cymbalaria as precursors to Parietaria on newly-built or restored walls, being overwhelmed as the latter increased its cover. Where there is local enrich-ment around walls and cliffs, the Parietarietum occurs with the Urtica-Galium community. On coastal shore-banks and cliff-tops, the Daucus sub-community can give way to the Festuca-Daucus grassland with an increase in grass cover and higher fre-quency of herbs like Sanguisorba minor and Plantago lanceolata.

"s1","Zonation and succession In west Norfolk, the Caricetum elatae may occasionally fill more shallow hollows but it usually occurs as a zone around open water or gives way in deeper water to the https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.031 Published online by Cambridge University PressSI Caricetum elatae sedge-swamp 129 Cladietum marisci (Haslam 1965, Wheeler 1975). Mosaics of the two dominants commonly occur at the junctions of the communities. Away from the water, the zonation varies with the basin slope: on more gradual surrounds, there is often a fairly sharp transition to some kind of rush-pasture and then to calcicolous grassland; around more steeply sided hollows, calcicolous grassland may abut directly on to the Caricetum elatae (Wheeler 1975). In its Cumbrian localities, the community occurs in close association with the Potentillo-Caricetum rostratae to which it grades in deeper water and elements of which may occur between the C. elata tussocks forming mosaics (Pearsall 1918, Holdgate 1955/?, Pigott & Wil son 1978). The advance of the Caricetum elatae and its gradual colonisation by Salix atrocinerea and Alnus glutinosa form part of the successional changes catalogued at Esthwaite North Fen over some 50 years (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wilson 1978). Here, an area of what seems to have been Phragmitetum australis reed swamp and Potentillo-Caricetum rostratae in 1914-16 was occupied by the Caricetum elatae by 1929 and by 1969 had an open woodland cover. C. elata appears to be tolerant of a certain amount of shade (Pigott & Wilson 1978), although beneath a Salix-Alnus canopy, its dominance weakens and the major tussock sedge in the open woodland at this site is C. paniculata.

"s10","Zonation and succession In open-water transitions of larger lakes, especially where nutrient-poor waters occur over organic sub strates, the community occurs in similar zonations to those involving the Caricetum rostratae and it com monly grades laterally to that community with a switch in dominance to C. rostrata. On more inorganic material in such situations, it may also occur alongside the E. fluviatile sub-community of the Eleocharitetum palustris (e.g. Spence 1964). Around the margins of reservoirs and lowland pools with inorganic substrates, the Equisetum sub-community often forms a zone, sometimes with the Eleocharis sub-community of the Eleocharitetum, between open water and Elymo-Rumicion inundation communities or, where stock water, poached Cynosurion swards (Figure 13). https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.040 Published online by Cambridge University PressS10 Equisetetum fluviatile swamp 173 Distribution "
"s11","Zonation and succession Although stands of the Carex vesicaria sub-community can occur in standing open water, the usual position of the community in marginal zonations is for it to occur inshore of the Caricetum rostratae to which it may grade through the Carex rostrata sub-community. Around such higher reaches and along the banks of dykes, the Mentha sub-community may occur alongside or pass to the Phragmitetum australis or to the Phalaridetum arundinaceae. Distribution "
"s12","Zonation and succession In open-water transitions around larger water bodies, the community may form the distal limit of emergent zonations, although its occurrence is often patchy (e.g. Meres Report 1980). In less eutrophic waters and/or where the substrate is more organic, there may be a transition through the Carex rostrata sub-community to the Caricetum rostratae in deeper water. Towards drier ground, the Typhetum may give way, sometimes through the Mentha sub-community, to fairly rich fenvegetation such as that of the Phragmites-Eupatorium community or the Caricetum paniculatae and this may in turn pass to carr woodland. Often, however, the community is part of more trun cated zonations, especially in smaller ponds and dykes, and here, too, the vegetation is sometimes influenced by eutrophication from agricultural or industrial run-off. Dense stands of the Typha sub-community often choke such water bodies, passing on the banks to Phragmites-Urtica fen or tail-herb vegetation such as the Phalaride-tum arundinaceae or the Epilobietum hirsutae (Figure 14). On the margins of sluggish streams, canals and wider dykes, patches of the Typha sub-community may occur in deeper water and give way, through the Alisma sub community, to the Sparganietum erecti\ in other cases, fragments of the Alisma sub-community and the Sparganietum may occur side by side in the shallows.

On the salt-marshes at Bridgwater and Berrow in Somerset, the Typha sub-community occurs in association with the Scirpetum maritimi. Although the association between the Typhetum and sites with active silt accretion is commonplace, there is very little systematic information available about its role in succession. At North Fen, Esthwaite, in Cumbria, the community has spread over 70 years from its confines on the rapidly accumulating material around the mouth of the Black Beck to form a belt between the Phragmitetum australis swamp and the Potentillo-Caricetum (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wilson 1978).Distribution "
"s13","Zonation and succession Stands of the community, sometimes patchy or forming but a narrow belt, may abut directly on to open water or be fronted by a narrow zone of the Scirpetum lacustris. In small ponds and along dyke margins, the Typhetum may give way in shallower water to the Sparganietum erecti but in larger and gradual open-water transitions the community may be part of more extensive zonations passing landwards to other types of swamp such as the Phragmitetum australis, the Caricetum paniculatae or the Cladietum marisci which may, in turn, grade to rich https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.043 Published online by Cambridge University Press186 Swamps and tail-herb fens fen vegetation of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum (e.g. Lambert & Jennings 1951, Lambert 1951, Sinker 1962, Wheeler 1978, 1980 a). Around the Bure broads in Norfolk, detailed stratigraphical evidence has been adduced to show that such zonations represent a variety of successional sequences which share an identical early stage in which the Typhetum angustifoliae plays a major role in the colonisation of open water (Lambert & Jennings 1951, Lambert 1951). In this area, P. australis was the usual coloniser of the Typhetum, building up a fairly stable semi-floating raft into which the cypera-ceous dominants then invaded. At Sweat Mere in Shropshire, C. paniculata seems to colonise the Typhetum directly (Sinker 1962). It is clear, however, that, in some areas, the extent of the Typhetum and presumably therefore its status in successions have been modified since the earlier accounts. First, the aquatic element so prominent in past descriptions of the community and of the fronting Scirpetum has been much depleted by disturbance and eutrophication. Second, loss of Typhetum itself has been an important component in the general decline of swamp reported from Broadland in recent years (e.g. Boorman & Fuller 1981). Typha spp. are eaten by larger wildfowl (Ogilvie 1978) although P. australis seems to be preferred against T. angustifolia by greylag and preferential grazing of mixed or contiguous stands may, indeed, give the latter a temporary advantage (Fiala & Kvet 1971, Boorman & Fuller 1981). T. angustifolia is, however, avidly eaten by coypu which will dig up the roots and rhizomes, a rich source of carbohydrate in winter, and which seem to prefer it to P. australis (Gosling 1974). Anon (1978) considered T. angustifolia to have been particularly badly hit by coypu and, in their confirmation of the importance of this animal in the general Broadland swamp decline, Boorman & Fuller (1981) showed how, at some sites, the marginal fringe had been pushed back with the virtual elimination of the Scirpetum and Typhetum zone to leave P. australis as the coloniser in shallower water. Distribution "
"s14","Zonation and succession Extensive stands of the community are rare, although the Sparganium sub-community sometimes chokes the centre of small ponds and narrow channels. More often, one or more of the sub-communities occurs in a belt with aquatic communities, other swamps and tail-herb vege tation in zonations related to water depth and water movement in open-water transitions and as riparian sequences. In the standing waters of ponds and dykes, bands of the Sparganium or Alisma sub-communities often give way in deeper water to Potamogeton natans and duckweeds (e.g. Walker 1905). On gently shelving margins with silty substrates, the Sparganietum may form a mosaic with the Eleocharis sub-community of the Eleocharitetum palustris or grade to it in shallower water. Limits of inundation in fluctuating waters are sometimes marked by a fairly abrupt change to the Phalaridetum arundinaceae, and the Phalaris sub community may form a narrow transition. Where graz ing stock have access and the substrate becomes poached (a common occurrence around streams and farm ponds), a fretted zone of the Sparganietum may give way to a patchy Glycerietumfluitantis or the Agrostis stolonifera-Alopecurus geniculatus community. Where there is a switch to clayey ground-water gleys on pond margins, there can be a transition through the Mentha sub-community of the Sparganietum to Holco-Juncion rush-pastures. Along streams and rivers, the movement of water and the generally more steeply shelving banks often rise to rather different zonations which may be much frag mented or conflated. A common pattern is for a zone of the Alisma sub-community to pass in deeper water to the Sparganium sub-communities of the Typhetum latifoliae or Scirpetum lacustris and to give way in the shallows to the Alisma-Sparganium sub-community of the Glycerietum maximae (e.g. Haslam 1978). On the lower reaches of permanent chalk streams, where clay begins to constitute a considerable proportion of the substrate, the Sparganietum may occur in similar sequences in a patchy mosaic with the Caricetum acutiformis and, along peat dykes, the community sometimes fronts a zone of the Phragmitetum australis (e.g. Haslam 1978). In many cases, however, the Sparganietum occurs in patchy mosaics along stream and dyke sides with scat tered clumps of the above communities or with the Caricetum otrubae or Carex pseudocyperus swamp. Although S. erectum is capable of considerable small rhizome extension and spread of the community may aid the colonisation of small open water bodies, the species does not seem to be able to compete with the more robust P. australis and Typha spp. (Cook 1961 ). In running waters any advance of the community is often repeatedly set back by erosion of the banks. Distribution "
"s15","Zonation and succession Acorus was introduced into Britain, probably before 1660 (Salisbury 1964) and for the medicinal value of its underground organs (Haslam 1978). It was planted thereafter as an ornamental and its sweet-smelling leaves have been used for strewing in churches (Salisbury 1964, Ellis 1965). Isolated stands in ornamental pools often represent deliberate plants but, although seed is not produced in Europe, Acorus spreads well by vegetative means and the Lemna sub-community perhaps includes stands of natural swamp and marginal vegetation which have been invaded.

"s19","Zonation and succession The community can occur as the distal component of swamp and fen zonations in open-water transitions. The Littorella sub-community is commonly found in such situations over sand and gravels around exposed shores in some Scottish lakes (Spence 1964). Here, it grades in deeper water to submerged vegetation with combinations of L. uniflora, Lobelia dortmanna and Juncus bulbosus. In other cases there is a front of the Scirpetum lacustris in deeper water. Inshore, this sub-community can give way to the Caricetum rostratae, the Caricetum vesicariae, the Phragmitetum australis or the Phafaride-tum arudinaceae (e.g. Pearsall 1918). In lowland open-water transitions with silty sub strates the Eleocharis sub-community can again lead the zonation giving way to aquatic vegetation with Potamogeton natans and duckweeds in deeper water or occur in shallow water mosaics with the Equisetetum fluviatile and the Sparganietum erecti. The Agrostis sub-community has been encountered as a dense fringe to streams running across the upper salt marsh in a few isolated localities in west Wales and around the Scottish coast (Adam 1976,1981). On Arran, it also occurs in flushes among coastal rocks and here E. palustris seems to replace E. uniglumis which is very rare https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.049 Published online by Cambridge University Press204 Swamps and tail-herb fens on the island but the usual Eleocharis sp. dominant in such northern situations (Adam et al. 1977). Distribution "
"s2","Zonation and succession The centres of small basin mires and peat cuttings may be completely filled by dense stands of the community. In other cases, the Cladietum survives patchily in pools and stagnant dykes within largely terrestrialised mire complexes, giving way to a variety of fen or poor-fen communities. In grossly disturbed and abandoned sites, the community may occur in juxtaposition with the Phragmites australis-Urtica dioica fen. In larger hollows, the Cladietum may give way directly to open standing water or, around 'pulk-holes', it may abut on to bare silt (Lambert 1951). In some sites, there is a swamp mosaic of the community with the Caricetum elatae, apparently in relation to the height and shortterm variability of the water-table (Haslam 1965). Around more extensive open-water transitions, the Cla dietum may occur patchily in the shallower waters in association with Phragmites swamps and, especially to the north and west, the Caricetum rostratae (Holdgate 19556). Exceptionally the community may be found as https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.032 Published online by Cambridge University PressS2 Cladietum marisci sedge-swamp 133 part of more intact zonations as at Upton Broad in Norfolk. Here, Lambert & Jennings (1951) described sequences running from the Typhetum angustifoliae and/or Phragmitetum australis through the Cladietum to carr woodland on the thicker, drier peats away from the open broad. From the more fragmentary pattern of vegetation in the flood-plain mire remnants at Wicken Fen, Godwin & Bharucha (1932) had shown how the distribution of Phragmites swamp, the Cladietum and carr in such transitions could be related to differences in the height of the water-table, and particularly to the extent of water excess in winter. This they saw as representing a primary succession involving the colonisation of open water by Phragmites, still remaining as a swamp along lodes and around pools, the invasion of the Phragmites swamp by Cladium, best seen in the old peat cuttings, and the gradual colonisation of the 'Pure Sedge' by bushes. Stratigraphical analysis of the Broadland deposits under the zonations described by Lambert & Jennings (1951) revealed a similar picture, except that there, a second phase of Phragmites dominance seemed to be interposed between the Cladietum and the carr (Lambert 1951). Despite this, and the rarity with which Lambert (1951) observed direct bush invasion of dense uncut Cladietum around the Bure broads, the advance of woody species into the community at Wicken has been plotted in some detail (Godwin & Tansley 1929, Godwin & Bharucha 1932). Here, the most frequent invaders were Frangula alnus, then Rhamnus catharticus, Salix cinerea and Viburnum opulus, with very small amounts of Crataegus monogyna and Betula pendula. These gained a hold in the Cladietum towards its uppermost boundary, the seedlings surviving down to a critical limit of bush growth where the peat surface experienced shallow winter flooding of several weeks' duration (Godwin & Bharucha 1932, Godwin 1943/?). Initial patchy bush colonisation over a period of 20 years or so was followed by gradual infill of the canopy and eventual extinction of the dense Cladium cover (Godwin & Tansley 1929, Godwin 1936). The long survival of the sedge was perhaps due to its evergreen nature (Conway 1942). Studies at Wicken also revealed how repeated sum mer cutting of the Cladietum 'Pure Sedge' might deflect the primary succession to produce 'Mixed Sedge' and 'Litter' (Godwin 1929, 1941; Godwin & Tansley 1929), vegetation represented in this scheme by various kinds of Cirsio-Molinie tum, described among the mires of Volume 2.

"s21","Zonation and succession The Scirpetum maritimi can occur at various levels on coastal salt-marshes and, exceptionally, there may be a zonation within stands between the various sub-communities, from the Scirpus-dominated type at the lowest level, through the Atriplex and Agrostis sub-communities, to the Potentilla sub-community. More often, stands of one or other of the sub-communities, sometimes quite small in extent, occur within other salt marsh communities, forming mosaics with the Puccinel-lietum maritimae or, more usually, the Juncetum gerardi, the Juncetum maritimi (Packham & Liddle 1970) or the Festuca rubra-Agrostis stolonifera-Potentilla anserina mesotrophic grassland. The boundaries of the Scirpetum maritimi are generally sharply marked by the dominance of S. maritimus but the vegetation types may grade one into another through the associates in the subsidiary layer of the swamp.In estuaries, the Scirpetum maritimi is sometimes the pioneer vegetation in an inverted zonation, as on the Exe for example, where it occurs down-slope from the Spartinetum townsendii and the Juncetum gerardi (Proctor 1980). The community also grades to other swamp types in salt-marsh depressions or on estuarine foreshores. It frequently passes gradually into the Scirpetum tabernaemontani with a switch in dominance between the two Scirpus taxa and mosaics with the Phragmitetum australis are common. On the Nith in the Solway Firth and at Dingwall in the Cromarty Firth, the Scirpetum maritimi occurs seaward of the Atriplex sub-community of this swamp type. In a number of sheltered sea-lochs in western Scot land, the community occurs as a fringe of emergent vegetation giving way sharply above to Alnus woodland, a zonation which is widespread in the Baltic (Tyler 1969/?).

"s22","Zonation and succession Sometimes, the three sub-communities occur as a zonation around the edges of deeper ponds. Often, however, small stands of the Glycerietum form a mosaic among other swamp communities on the more open margins of pools and streams.

On the Ouse Washes the community occurs in mosaics with the Agrostis stolonifera-Alopecurus geniculatus inundation grassland in areas which are sheep-grazed in summer and subject to shallow winter flooding. https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.052 Published online by Cambridge University PressS22 Glycerietum fluitantis swamp 217 Distribution "
"s23","Zonation and succession In shallow, standing or sluggish waters, the vegetation often occurs as a fringe to the Glycerietum maximae, the Typhetum latifoliae and the Sparganietum erecti and in more intact sequences, some of its species may run under more open stands of these emergents to constitute a sparse understorey of the assemblage G type. Often, however, zonations are very much compressed and, along many dykes and canals, clumps of this vegetation alternate with stands of emergents. These more patchy and fragmentary mixtures also occur with swamps like the Caricetum acutiformis, the A core turn calami and the Sagittaria sagittifolia and Carex pseudocyperus communities. In running waters with a moderate flow, the most frequent neighbouring swamp is the Sparganietum erecti but, in more swiftly moving waters, even this may disappear, leaving a broken fringe of this Glycerio-Sparganion vegetation, perhaps backed by clumps of the Phalaridetum. Such patterns are also characteristic of the margins of some more permanent river shoals. Another very common pattern, around the edges of ponds and along stream margins where stock water, is for this vegetation to occur with the Glycerietum fluitan tis in transitions to damp mesotrophic pastures such as the Holco-Juncetum or certain kinds of Lolio-Cynosure-tum. Slumped fragments of these communities often occur intermixed with Glycerio-Sparganion vegetation in a confusing jumble along stream beds. Periodic disturbance often sets back any serai pro gression in the habitats in which this vegetation typically occurs but, in more stable situations, it seems to give way to swamps like the Glycerietum maximae, the Typhetum latifoliae and the Sparganietum erecti. Its most frequent species are light-demanding (Haslam 1978) and, though they may persist for some time as a swamp understorey, they disappear as the emergents advance and become more dense. Distribution "
"s24","Zonation and succession In Broadland, the Peucedano-Phragmitetum generally occupies the middle zone of the flood-plain mires between the open water of the rivers and broads and the valley sides. In some places, it forms part of a complete and fairly clear sequence from swamp through fen to scrub and woodland, including vegetation developed over both the colonised margins of the deep peat cuts of the broads and the intact alluvial deposits behind. Such zonations have, however, been much confused, especially on these drier solid substrates towards their landward limit, by the various traditional mowing treatments and shallow peat digging, and are now further complicated by neglect and the spread of woody vege tation over the abandoned fen compartments and dykes. Towards the open water, the transitions have been truncated somewhat by coypu activity and affected by eutrophication. The whole area occupied by these com munities has, moreover, been reduced and fragmented by the progressive reclamation of the flood-plain mires for intensive farming. The Peucedano-Phragmitetum therefore survives here as part of sometimes extensive but often isolated tracts of complex vegetation over a largely decayed agricultural landscape now subject to the renewed but modified influence of a flood-plain mire environment. Those few areas of the community which exist outside Broadland occur in smaller and even more isolated and modified fragments of vegetation, far removed from the natural seasonal fluctuations of large bodies of open water and generally sharply marked off from the sur rounding land which has been intensively drained, widely cut over for peat and which now carries improved grassland or arable on its shrunken and wasted surface. Here, extensive zonations are rare, swamp vegetation being largely confined to fragmentary strips in the remaining open dykes and the compartments having complex patterns of fen and woody vegetation much influenced by treatment and neglect. The natural disposition of the community between swamp on the one hand and scrub and woodland on the other is most clearly related to the water-table and, in some places in Broadland, it is possible to proceed sequentially through the various vegetation types in moving from broad margin to valley side over gently sloping ground that, in summer, is dry to increasingly greater depths and, in winter, is subject to increasingly shorter periods of inundation. Some of the classic profiles provided by Lambert & Jennings (1951) from the Bure valley show this well. The Peucedano-Phragmitetum generally occupies the zone where the substrate is sufficiently dry for the overwhelming dominance of swamp helophytes to be challenged by its characteristic suite of fen species but yet sufficiently wet to prevent the permanent establishment of shrubs and trees. The extent of this zone and the sharpness of its boundaries with swamp and woodland vary according to the pattern of interaction between the fluctuating water and the topography of the flood-plain deposits, but they are also influenced by the different tolerances which species have to isolation from the open waters and their irrigating effect. Gradual switches in dominance often blur the junction between swamp and fen and also produce some natural internal heterogeneity with the sub-commtfnities of the Peucedano-https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.054 Published online by Cambridge University Press230 Swamps and tail-herb fens Phragmitetum, as can be seen in the relationships between G. maxima and Phragmites in the Glyceria sub community and Phragmites and Cladium in the Typical sub-community, and the generally increased prominence of Juncus subnodulosus and Calamagrostis canescens further away from open water (see Habitat above). The upper boundary between the community and scrub and woodland is also made rather hazy by the varieties of shade tolerance which Peucedano-Phragmitetum spe cies have. Some of the important components of the community, e.g. Carex paniculata, C. acutiformis, C. vesicaria, Calamagrostis canescens and Thelypteris palustris, can persist under a shrub or tree cover producing a diffuse zone of overlap between fen and field layer that does not correspond exactly with the limit of the canopy. The particular sub-communities of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum involved in this basic zonation seem to depend partly on the trophic state of the waters and substrate which may itself be a function of the distance from freely circulating open waters. Along the Yare, with its marked tidally influenced water movement, the usual pattern is for the Glyceria sub-community to occur behind a front of the Glycerietum maximae swamp, although, with the neglect of the open dyke system along this river, the general prominence of G. maxima itself and the gradual nature of the transitions between extensive areas of swamp and primary fen so characteristic of Lambert's (1946) descriptions are much less obvious. In less eutrophic conditions without any pronounced diurnal fluctuation in water-level, the community can be fronted by bands of the Scirpetum lacustris, the Typhetum angustifoliae and the Phragmitetum australis in progressively shallower water, although this sequence has been much fretted by coypu activity (compare the descriptions of Pallis 1911, Lambert 1951 and Boorman & Fuller 1981 ). In some places, there is then a zone of the Caricetum paniculatae which passes to the Carexpaniculata sub-community of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum or, in a few localities, to fragments of the Cicuta sub community. More often, however, the Phragmitetum gives way directly to the Typical sub-community. In the most oligotrophic conditions, the Cladietum marisci may be the sole swamp community fronting Typical Peucedano-Phragmitetum (Lambert & Jennings 1951, Lambert 1951, Wheeler 1980c). In the most natural of these kinds of sequences, the community gives way, with varying degrees of abruptness to woodland with Alnus glutinosa, Salix cinerea and Betula pubescens (Figure 15). Much of the stratigraphical and observational evi dence which has been used to interpret such zonations as the spatial expression of a primary hydrosere has originated from Broadland (e.g. Lambert 1946, 1948, 1951; Lambert & Jennings 1951; Walker 1970; Wheeler 1980c). Here, the Peucedano-Phragmitetum includes all the primary fen which develops with the gradual autochthonous accumulation of organic matter over the lake muds around the broad margins, first above the lowest limit of permanent standing water, then up towards the highest bounds ever reached on the flood, with a pro gressive lowering of the water-table and a reduction in the deposition of any allochthonous sediments. The present distribution of the various kinds of primary Peucedano-Phragmitetum in relation to the nutrient conditions of the environment suggests that these may in some way control the particular direction which the succession takes through the community (Lambert 1946, 1951; Wheeler 1980a, c, 1983; Wheeler & Giller 1982a). Lambert (1946, 1951) characterised four "major pathways of succession and later observations tend to bear out their early stages except that, at the present time, Carex acutiformis seems to have a less distinctive role than she suggested. This species is not a very good diagnostic taxon for any sub-community and, in Lambert's own studies, it was shown to be strongly influenced by mowing (Lambert 1946, 1948) and also to be more characteristic in some places of subsequent woodland than of preceeding fen (Lambert 1951). In great measure, the direction of the succession seems to be already set by the swamp stage. Although the distinctive fen associates of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum show some sorting according to the nutrient status of the waters and substrate, the swamp helophytes continue to exert some influence on the vegetation, especially on its physiognomy, and they contribute to some extent, to the particular floristic character of those sub-communities which occur as primary fen. Their growth form may also influence the speed with which the succession passes, not only from the swamps to the Peucedano-Phragmitetum, but also from fen to scrub and woodland. Although the absolute limit of shrub and tree invasion is probably controlled by the water-table, and especially perhaps by its maximum winter level (e.g. Godwin & Bharucha 1932, Godwin 1936), this will itself be influenced by the rate of accumulation of litter and the extent to which seedlings can gain a hold will also be affected by the density of both living and dead material on the ground. Along the Yare, for example, Lambert (1946) noted that scrub development did not generally begin in primary fen of the Glyceria sub-community until after the invasion of Phragmites when the blanketing effect of the luxuriant and lodged shoots of G. maxima was broken up; then abundant Salix cinerea appeared, followed by Alnus glutinosa. A dense cover of Cladium in Typical Peucedano-Phragmitetum may be similarly inimical to seedling establishment (Lambert 1951), although at Wicken it has been shown that some woody species can invade virtually pure Cladietum marisci directly (Godwin & Tansley 1929, Godwin & https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.054 Published online by Cambridge University PressS24 Peucedano-Phragmitetum australis fen 231 Bharucha 1932, Godwin 1943£>). The Carex paniculata sub-community, on the other hand, is especially prone to early invasion, with abundant seedlings of both S. cinerea and A. glutinosa quickly growing up on the tussock tops and forming a canopy (Lambert 1951). The dominants of primary Peucedano-Phragmitetum also exert some influence on the floristics and physiognomy of the eventual woodland cover. The distinctions which Lambert (1951,1965) made between 'swamp carr' and 'semi-swamp carr' seem to be largely structural and most of the /l/Hi/s-dominated woodland in which Carex paniculata and/or C. acutiformis are prominent can be incorporated within the single community of Alnus glutinosa-Carex paniculata woodland. The Alnus gluti-nosa-Filipendula ulmaria sub-community of the Salix cinerea-Betula pubescens-Phragmites australis is rather similar in its canopy composition but seems to correspond to the 'fen carr' of Lambert (1951,1965), which she saw as the natural development from the kinds of Peucedano-Phragmitetum in which either Phragmites or Cladium had been dominant. It is difficult to assess the absolute rate of these kinds of primary succession but Lambert & Jennings (1951) noted that, along the Bure at least, the limits of the open Broads waters shown on the 1838-41 Tithe Maps coin-Figure 15. Variations among sequences of swamp, tail-herb fen and woodland vegetation in open-water transition mires around lowland standing and sluggish waters. cided roughly with the original limits of lake muds in the deep medieval peat cuttings. This would suggest that, whether the Broads remained open prior to this time for natural reasons or not, most of the visible colonisation from swamp through, in places, to woodland, has occurred within the last 150 years. Stratigraphical analysis of the solid peats and clays nearer the valley sides (Jennings & Lambert 1951, Lambert & Jennings 1951) has revealed a picture of a simpler and more gradual succession following the final marine transgression. Here, vegetation dominated by Phragmites seems to have given way directly to 'fen carr’, some of which was thought to have a possibly direct continuity with the original woodland cover (Lambert & Jennings 1951). Over much of the extent of these firmer deposits, however, the long history of interference means that much of the woodland cover is probably of secondary origin. It is very difficult to extract from the diverse relationships between fen treatment and the vegetation, any coherent schemes of secondary succession attendant upon continued treatment or, now, its almost total demise. Nevertheless, a number of tentative observations can be made. First, on the drier peats at Wicken, Godwin (1941) demonstrated a reversible relationship between sedge-dominated vegetation very similar to the Symphytum sub-community and a Molinia caerulea-dommated grassy sward based on the frequency of summer cut tings, the latter vegetation being favoured by annual cropping for litter. Comparable vegetation was also S8 Scirpetum lacustris swamp S13 Typhetum angustifoliae swamp SWAMPS4 Phragmitetum australis swampS3 Caricetum paniculatae swampS5 Glycerietum maximae swampS4 Phragmitetum australis swampS2 Cladietum marisci swamp TALL-HERB FENS26 Phragmites-Urtica fen a Filipendula sub communityS25 Phragmites-Eupatorium tail-herb fen a Phragmites b Carex sub-sub community communityS24 Peucedano-Phragmitetum tail-herb fen a Carex b Glyceria b Typical sub-sub-sub community community community WOODLANDW6 Alnus-Urtica woodlandW2 Salix-Betula-Phragmites Woodland https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.054 Published online by Cambridge University Press232 Swamps and tail-herb fens shown by Lambert (1946) to be characteristic of areas along the Yare, subject to similar treatment and far from the irrigating effect of the waters. Such sustained sum mer mowing, especially on drier peats, seems to be one of the most effective ways of breaking the cycle of maintenance of secondary fen by converting the Peucedano-Phragmitetum to another vegetation type. Systematic grazing by stock, especially when combined with embankment and drainage, is probably another. On the grazed levels of the Yare, the community appears to develop into the Holco-Juncetum under such treatment (Lambert 1948). More drastic disturbance of drier peats may result in oxidation of the organic deposits and a release of nutrients (e.g. Haslam 1965) with an increase in nitrophilous species. Such a development is perhaps already seen within the Glyceria and Symphytum sub communities but it may also transform the Peucedano-Phragmitetum into the tail-herb fens of the Phragmites-Urtica community or the Epilobietum hirsutae. Second, how far such disruptions as these prevent the eventual re-establishment, with neglect, of the kinds of woodland that result from the primary succession is unknown. At Wicken, there seems to have been an opportunistic recolonisation of abandoned sedge-beds with the establishment of a cover largely of Rhamnus catharticus and Frangula alnus (Godwin 1936, Godwin et al. 1974), although A. glutinosa is regenerating in places. In the Yare fens, Lambert (1946) suggested that secondary Alnus woodland, though readily developing from litter-mown areas, was deficient in Carex paniculata as compared with primary carr. It is possible that more disturbed tail-herb fens regress to Alnus glutinosa-Urtica dioica woodland. In some places, the re-development of woodland is complicated by the possibility of surface acidification of undisturbed peats which are now above the water-table. In Broadland, the Schoenus sub-community is asso ciated with uncut baulks and, with a cessation of mowing, this vegetation is rapidly invaded by Myrica gale, first to form the Myrica sub-community of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum and then a Myrica scrub. This, in turn, may progress to the Betula-Molinia woodland (Wheeler 1980c). The recent marked expansion of B. pubescens on the drier peats at Wicken (Godwin et al. 1974) seems to be related to surface acidification. Indeed, it is not impossible that here and in some parts of Broadland there survive, as at Woodwalton (Poore 1956/?), fragments of a pre-existing cover of acid peat that has been systematically stripped off (Wheeler 1978). Third, the flooding of shallow peat cuttings, such as those dug quite extensively in some Broadland valleys in the mid-nineteenth century, seems to have created rather specialised conditions for the development of a somewhat different hydrosere to any of those characteristic of the broads margins themselves. Here, swamp vegetation may include stands of that distinct form of the Galium palustre sub-community of the Phragmitetum which Wheeler (1980«) termed Cicuto-Phragmitetum developed over a floating raft of Typha angustifolia remains (see also Lambert 1951). Other such flooded workings are at present occupied by rafts of the Carex lasiocarpa variant of the Cicuta sub-community of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum and it is possible that the two are serally related (Wheeler 1980c). Within areas con taining stands of either or both of these vegetation types there are sometimes small islands of the Sphagnum sub community of the Salix cinerea-Betula pubescens-Phragmites australis woodland often picked out by the prominence of the bright green fronds of Dryopteris cristata around the margins (Wheeler 1978). At least some of these seem to represent the development of ombrotrophic nuclei on floating rafts of peat which are kept out of reach of flooding with the calcareous and nutrient-rich broads waters (Wheeler 1978, 1980c, 1983; Giller 1982). Although such mires seem to have formed within the nearby Fens (e.g. Godwin & Clifford 1938, Poore 1956/?; see also Godwin & Turner 1933, Walker 1970), their formation in Broadland at the present time seems to be strongly associated with artificial habitats. Even the large island at the north end of Barton Broad, which has a particularly extensive stand of this kind of woodland (Wheeler 1978), is known to have been piled around the edge and infilled with slushy dredgings (Lambert & Jennings 1965). The vegetation of these shallow peat diggings is often further complicated by their isolation from the main paths of water movement through the broads and dykes and by the possible lateral seepage of water at the junctions of the flood-plain mire with the valley sides. It is in such positions that the Cicuta sub-community can occur in striking mosaics with a carpet of the Carex rostrata-Calliergon fen. These mosaics, which Wheeler (1978, 1980«) included within the Peucedano-Phragmitetum as the sub-community caricetosum but which are fully described in this scheme under the Car ex-Calliergon fen, are the locus of a number of Broadland rarities, including Liparis loeselii, Anagallis tenella, Drosera ang lica, Parnassia palustris and Hypericum elodes. The detailed environmental relationships of this kind of vegetation and its possible role in any fen succession are unknown. Distribution "
"s25","Zonation and succession The Phragmites-Eupatorium fen occurs typically in small, often linear, stands in complexes of herbaceous and woody vegetation on mires which are now often sharply marked off from surrounding agricultural land. In more intact valley mires, the Phragmites and Carex paniculata sub-communities may form a zone along the river terraces, sometimes grading in open water to Phragmitetum australis swamp. On drier ground there may be a transition to the Salix cinerea-Betula pubes-cens-Phragmites australis woodland or Alnus glutinosa-Carexpaniculata woodland. This probably represents a fairly natural succession on alluvial deposits in these calcareous and fairly eutrophic valley mires and Haslam (1965) adduced some documentary evidence that S. cinerea carr had succeeded P/zragmzZes-dominated vege tation in 50 years in a Breckland site. Frequently, however, such successions have been disturbed and zonations are more complex (Figure 16). Peat digging and mowing for litter are known to have occurred in some valley mires and the abandonment of these practices, together with subsequent interference such as periodic burning, channel dredging, the construction of embankments and the drainage of surrounding land, is often marked now by a patchwork of the Phragmites-Eupatorium fen with more eutrophic communities such as the tail-herb vegetation of the Phragmites-Urtica fen and the Epilobietum hirsutae (e.g. Haslam 1965, Rat cliffe & Hattey 1982) and the Alnus glutinosa-Urtica dioica woodland over the dry and disturbed alluvium. In some valley mires, there is a natural marginal transition from the community to the Schoeno-Juncetum along a spring-line (Haslam 1965, Wheeler 1980c). Often, though, the accessible edges of valley mires have been open to stock and grazing has obscured any zonations. In such situations, well described from the East Kent fens (Rose 1950) and the Gordano Valley in Somerset (Willis & Jefferies 1959), the Phragmites-Eupatorium fen may survive only around the wetter streams and dykes in a landscape of fen-meadow. Similar patterns can be seen on some disturbed spring mires, such as those described from the Little Ouse-Waveney watershed on the Norfolk-Suffolk border (Bellamy & Rose 1961, Haslam 1965). In more eutrophic calcareous topogenous mires, the community can occur as a zone between swamps and woodland, although here, too, patterns may be confused by disturbance and truncated above by sharp transitions to agricultural land. Some open-water transitions and flood-plain mires have a belt of the Phragmites or Carex paniculata sub-communities between the Phragmitetum or Caricetum paniculatae and Alnus woodland, as in certain of the Shropshire Meres (Sinker 1962, Meres Report 1980). In smaller basin mires, such as some of those in Anglesey, the Cladium sub-community can occur as a zone grading in open water to the Cladietum marisci or the Caricetum elatae or in a mosaic with the Schoeno-Juncetum and fen-meadow vegetation. https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.055 Published online by Cambridge University PressFigure 16.

Stands are sometimes extensive and may occur as a definite zone as in some of the Yare fens described by Lambert (1946) where a belt of the Epilobium sub-community, dominated by G. maxima or, less frequently, by P. australis, graded to the Glycerietum maximae alongside open water. In other cases, the community may pass to the Phragmitetum australis or the Caricetum paniculatae (e.g. Haslam 1965 in the Breck valley fens) or occur with the Caricetum ripariae (as in some of the Pembrokeshire valley and flood-plain mires: Ratcliffe & Hattey 1982). Very often, however, stands are fragmentary and form a patchy mosaic with richer fens of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum (in Broadland) or the Phragmites-Eupatorium community, on wetter and/or less disturbed ground, and tail-herb vege tation dominated by E. hirsutum or U. dioica in drier and/or more disturbed places. Stands of Alnusglutinosa-Urtica dioica or Alnus-Carex paniculata woodlands can occur with these patchworks and the Phragmites-Urtica fen is sometimes found in disturbed clearings within these woodlands. In mire remnants which have been grazed, the community may pass to fen meadow vege tation on drier ground. In eutrophicated and disturbed spring mires, zonations are often sharp, small stands of the community occurring alongside ditches or within Schoeno-Juncetum or grazed fen-meadow (Haslam 1965). By ditches and water-courses in agricultural land, too, patches or strips of the Phragmites-Urtica fen may be abruptly marked off from adjacent farmland, although here and in urban wetlands, the community can occur in fragmentary mosaics with tail-herb and weed vegetation where there is much disturbance. Where the Oenanthe sub-community occurs on the upper salt-marsh, it has been observed to pass sharply to the Atriplici-Elymetum pycnanthi moving downshore (Proctor 1980). Only in a few situations where waters are naturally eutrophic does the Phragmites-Urtica fen seem to be a primary vegetation type developed as part of a hydrarch succession. In most cases, it seems to be a secondary community which partly or wholly replaces richer fens in response to artificial enrichment and disturbance. Its dense cover does not appear easily open to the invasion of woody species but continued natural drying of the fen surface or drainage and subsequent abandonment may lead to the development of tail-herb vegetation without Phragmites which itself may represent a fairly stable phase in a deflected succession (Haslam 1965). Distribution "
"s27","Zonation and succession In more extensive and undisturbed open-water transitions, the Carex-Equisetum sub-community (and, rarely the Lysimachia sub-community) occurs as part of com plete zonations between submerged aquatic vegetation and woodland. Around lakes and some larger basin mires, it is generally fronted by a zone of the Caricetum rostratae, the Equisetetum fluviatile or, at scattered localities, especially in Scotland, by the Caricetum vesi cariae. Boundaries between these swamps and the Potentillo-Caricetum are often very hazy with a gradual increase in shallower water in Potentilla palustris and Menyanthes trifoliata and a continuing prominence of the swamp dominants within the fen. In other cases, virtually pure stands of P. palustris or M. trifoliata themselves may extend out into open water in front of the community (Matthews 1914, Spence 1964, Birse 1980, Lock & Rodwell 1981). At some sites, a belt of the Phragmitetum forms a more abrupt outer edge to the Potentillo-Caricetum (e.g. Pearsall 1918, Lock & Rod well 1981). On drier ground, the community may grade, through an open scatter of Salix cinerea bushes, to the Salix-Carex rostrata woodland in which some important Potentillo-Caricetum species remain as part of the understorey. There is little doubt that such sequences represent a natural succession around more mesotro-phic, sometimes base-rich and calcareous lakes and basins to the north and west. At Esthwaite Fen in Cumbria, it has been shown how the Potentillo-Caricetum has extended out behind a front of the Phragmitetum and been colonised from behind by S. cinerea over the past seventy years (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wilson 1978) and Lock & Rodwell (1981) adduced photographic evidence to support a similar succession at Crag Lough in Northumberland. Spence (1964) described a replacement of Caricetum rostratae by the Potentillo-Caricetum over fifty years on the shores of Loch Ness in Inverness, although at other sites there has been no perceptible change in the extent of these two communities. The levels of nutrients may play some part in influencing the rate of forward advance of the fen mat in such situations. Two things confuse this basic pattern of zonation and succession. The first is grazing, which can set back shrub and tree invasion where stock have access to the community. The effect of this is starkly visible at Crag Lough where a fence marks a sharp boundary between open Potentillo-Caricetum and closed Salix-Carex woodland. Grazing may also blur the boundary between the fen vegetation on the mire surface itself and that on the mineral or peaty soils surrounding it. Even where there is no woodland fringe to the community, this junction may be marked by a zone of Filipendulion vegetation, the Holco-Juncetum or the Phalaridetum arundinaceae at the limit of inundation or ground-water gleying. Where such margins are grazed, there tends to be a much more gradual transition from rush-pasture or fen-meadow communities to the Potentillo-Caricetum (e.g. Ratcliffe & Hattey 1982). The second feature, which has more complex results, is the variation in base-status, calcium content and nutrient levels that is very characteristic of soligenous areas in basins and around some raised mires. Such differences, which can be very marked over even short distances, are partly a function of distance from springs, seepage lines or streams but they can also be affected by ground-water fluctuations. The Potentillo-Caricetum is often found in places where it is difficult to separate the influence of soligenous, topogenous and ombrogenous effects and it frequently forms part of intricate mosaics with other mire communities. Particularly striking examples have been described from Sunbiggin Tarn in Cumbria (Holdgate 1955Z?) and Malham Tarn, North Yorkshire (Sinker 1960, Proctor 1974, Adam et al. 1975). Here, around the weaving inflow streams, the community occurs intimately mixed with the Carex rostrata-Calliergon fen in a baffling jumble of local differences in bryophyte distribution and dominance by a variety of Carices. The vagaries of dispersal and establishment may play some part in determining such patterns but they are probably also influenced by differences in water chemistry, although these have not been isolated (Proctor 1974, Wheeler 1980«, b, 1983). In such sites as these, there may also be more obvious zonations between either or both these fens and the Pinguiculo-Caricetum dioicae around highly calcareous springs and to Filipendulion vegetation along junctions with unflushed mineral soils or where banks of alluvium have been deposited by moving waters. A patchy development of the Salix-Carex woodland may add to the complexity. In less base-rich and calcareous mires, the Potentillo-Caricetum may occur in mosaics with poor-fen vege tation. Small patches of Sphagnum squarrosum and S. fimbriatum are sometimes found within stands of the community, where, for example, the surfaces of floating rafts are maintained at a high enough level to be free of frequent inundation (Wheeler 1980«, d; Lock & Rodwell 1981). Where such patches coalesce, other Sphagna, such as S. palustre, S. recurvum and S. teres, and Aulae omnium palustre may appear and Calliergon stra-mineum replace C. giganteum and C. cordifolium. Such changes mark a transition to the Carex rostrata-Sphagnum squarrosum community. In other places, the fading of any nutrient enrichment in the water flowing into basin or around raised mires is accompanied by a https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.057 Published online by Cambridge University PressS27 Potentillo-Caricetum rostratae tail-herb fen 255 gradation from the Potentillo-Caricetum to the much less species-rich Carex rostrata-Sphagnum recurvum mire, which has but scattered plants of M. trifoliata and P. palustris and a very poor representation of other herbs (e.g. Wheeler 1980af). Where fragments of ombro-trophic peat remain in such soligenous mires (as in the Malham fens) or where water tracks run in a well-defined lagg around raised mires, the community may pass very sharply to some form of ombrogenous bog or its derivative. Distribution "
"s28","Zonation and succession The community is often found as the terminating vege tation type around open-water transitions, marking the normal upper limit of water-level fluctuation. On the margins of lakes and pools it may pass, towards open water, directly to swamps such as the Phragmitetum australis, the Glycerietum maximae, the Typhetum lati foliae or the Sparganietum erecti, or there may be an intervening zone of the Phragmites-Eupatorium fen. Around enriched waters or in disturbed mires, the Epilobium-Urtica sub-community frequently forms an upper fringe to a patchwork of the Phragmites-Urtica fen. On the draw-down zones around reservoirs with silty shores, the community often passes sharply to a sequence of inundation communities. In its rare occurrences on salt-marches, the Phalaridetum normally forms a discontinuous and narrow fringe at the extreme upper limit, although in some estuaries it may occur further down-marsh above pioneer Scirpetum maritimi (e.g. Gilham 1957«). Similar zonations to those found around open standing waters, though often much condensed, are also characteristic of the margins of lowland water-courses with silty or clayey banks. On the more stony banks typical of faster-flowing streams over resistant rocks, the Phalaridetum is sometimes the only tall herbaceous fen vegetation, passing more or less directly to the moving open waters. On periodically inundated river shoals, clumps of the community may occur in mosaics with the Festuca arundinacea-Agrostis stolonifera community. Stands of the community may grade, at their upper edge, to Alnus glutinosa-Urtica dioica woodland or, by streams in upland margins, to Alnus glutinosa-Fraxinus excelsior-Lysimachia nemorum woodland, and occasionally clumps of P. arundinacea can occur in the field layers of these woodlands. Often, however, the upper margins of the Phalaridetum are sharply marked off from neighbouring pasture land. On drier soils where there is no grazing, there may be a more gradual transition through the Elymus-Holcus sub-community to some kind of Arrhenatheretum or to the Deschampsia cespitosa-Holcus lanatus grassland. On winter-flooded washlands, the Phalaridetum can pass, away from the less heavily grazed margins of dykes, to a mosaic of the Glycerietum fluitantis and the Agrostis stolonifera-Alopecurus geniculatus inundation grassland. Shrub and tree seedlings and saplings are rare in the Phalaridetum and no observational data is available as to succession but it seems most likely that the community progresses normally to the Alnus-Urtica woodland, or on the upland margins of the north and west, to the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland. Distribution "
"s3","Zonation and succession The Caricetum paniculatae may abut directly on to open water or give way to the Phragmitetum australis or the Typhetum angustifoliae. Although many stands are small and zonations fragmentary, the community is sometimes part of an intact sequence of vegetation from such deeper water swamps to carr (Clapham in Tansley 1939, Lambert 1951, Sinker 1962). In such cases, the Caricetum paniculatae may represent the most species poor swamp phase of C. paniculata dominance and give way to woodland through types of richer fen in which the sedge is still very prominent but where there is a more advanced colonisation of older tussock tops by Salix cinerea or S. atrocinerea and Alnus glutinosa, as in the https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.033 Published online by Cambridge University PressS3 Caricetum paniculatae sedge-swamp 137 communities of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum and the Phragmites-Eupatorium and Phragmites-Ur tic a fens. There is strong circumstantial, or sometimes firm stratigraphical, evidence for regarding such zonations as representing a serai development from open water to woodland in which the Caricetum paniculatae plays a major part (Clapham in Tansley 1939, Lambert 1951, Lambert & Jennings 1951, Sinker 1962, Wheeler 1983). Around pools in pasture, such sequences as those described may terminate above in an abrupt transition from the Caricetum paniculatae to some kind of grazed Calthion grassland within which tree colonisation is repeatedly set back. Where the community occurs more patchily in res ponse to local infiltration of calcareous, base-rich waters into basin mires, it may be surrounded by a variety of poor fens or base-poor mire communities (e.g. Poore & Walker 1959). Distribution "
"s4","Zonation and succession The wide ecological amplitude of Phragmites makes the Phragmitetum one of the commonest components of zonations in open-water transitions and flood-plain mires and means that a wide variety of other swamp and fen communities, with more exacting species, can be found in association with it. The Phragmitetum is also widespread in the more compressed or fragmentary sequences associated with dyke and canal margins and it has a scattered distribution within salt-marsh zonations. It also persists, sometimes because of deliberate treatment as a crop, in the often very complex patterns of vegetation associated with disturbed fens in flood-plain and valley mires. In more natural situations, the community occurs as part of zonations which can, in any particular site, be related most frequently to a gradient of water-level. In extensive open-water transitions it is often the most distal swamp type giving way directly, in deeper unpolluted waters, to floating-leaved or submerged aquatic vegetation. In some cases, stands are fronted by other swamp types: in lakes to the north and west, there is sometimes a belt of the Scirpetum lacustris (Pearsall 1918, Spence 1964) and this pattern was probably, at one time, more widespread (as in Broadland: see Pallis 1911, Lambert & Jennings 1951); in more eutrophic waters, the Typhetum angustifoliae occurs in this position (Lambert 1951) (Figure 12) or, in more sheltered sites in the rather peculiar conditions along the Yare valley in Norfolk, the Glycerietum maximae (Lambert 1946). Much conflated versions of these sequences occur com monly in mesotrophic and eutrophic dykes and canals (e.g. Haslam 1978). Where there is a substantial depth of water available for colonisation, it is usually the Phragmites sub community that leads such sequences or, in poorer waters especially over peat, the Menyanthes sub community (e.g. Birks 1973). In waters which are more shallow throughout, the Galium sub-community is more usual. Very commonly, a gradual reduction in waterlevel is matched by the Phragmites sub-community being replaced inshore by the Galium sub-community: this is the common pattern in larger lakes in Scotland and north-western England (e.g. Spence 1964). In these regions too, lake stands of the Phragmitetum tend to be less extensive, being often restricted to more nutrientrich areas of deposition, as around the deltas of input streams. This means that the community often forms a complex patchwork around the shores with other swamps like the Caricetum rostratae and the Caricetum vesicariae. https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.034 Published online by Cambridge University Press146 Swamps and tail-herb fens Figure 12.

In oligotrophic calcareous waters, the Cladietum marisci may occur here, or in more mesotrophic situations, the Caricetum paniculatae (Lambert & Jennings 1951, Lambert 1951). Along the Yare, a narrow front of the Phragmitetum, resistant to scour, can protect a bank of the Glycerietum maximae (Lambert 1946). Frequently, however, the community gives way dir ectly to some form of fen. The more landward parts of these zonations are strongly influenced by the trophic state of the substrate and also by human interference which, pushing out to the limit of standing water, has made intact sequences increasingly rare. In the more complete transitions, the Phragmitetum may pass gradually, through the Galium sub-community and with a progressive increase in the number and variety of associates, to fen vegetation in which Phragmites remains a prominent component. On mesotrophic silts and organic soils, there can be a zonations to the Phragmites-Eupatorium fen; this is a common, though often rather fragmentary, pattern in some valley mires (e.g. Haslam 1965). On the fen peats of Broadland, the Phragmitetum can give way to the very rich and varied Peucedano-Phragmitetum (e.g. Pallis 1911, Lambert & Jennings 1951, Wheeler 1978). In more acid and oligotrophic waters, the community may pass to a swinging mat of the Potentillo-Caricetum rostratae (e.g. Pearsall 1918, Holdgate 1955Z>, Pigott & Wilson 1978) which sometimes seems to be able to grow through and beyond the Phragmitetum. In the agricultural lowlands, many transitions of this kind have been truncated by systematic drainage and, even in those few places, like Broadland, where extensive tracts of swamp and fen remain, zonations are very complex and sometimes abrupt because of differences in treatment applied piecemeal to marsh parcels (e.g. Lambert 1948). A very common feature of disturbed and eutrophicated sites throughout the lowlands is the juxtaposition of the Phragmites or Galium sub-communities with various kinds of Phragmites-Urtica fen, the Phalaridetum or tail-herb vegetation like the Epilobietum hirsu-tae. Narrow strips of these vegetation types also occur widely in sequences along the banks of dykes. Although stands of the Phragmites sub-community are also found in brackish dykes behind reclamation banks, the majority of salt-marsh and estuarine occurrences of the community are in sites without permanent standing water. Sometimes stands of the Atriplex sub community seem to be simply superimposed upon the existing salt-marsh zonation, occurring within Puccinel-lietum or Juncetum gerardi swards. In other cases, this sub-community forms part of the complex of vegetation types that occurs around the upper-marsh transition where there is litter accumulation and/or freshwater seepage. In estuaries, stands of the Phragmitetum sometimes occur in the inverted zonations associated with reversals of salinity gradient. When undisturbed, the Phragmitetum can be a very persistent community. Phragmites can retain its dominance under a wide variety of conditions and in optimal habitats stands can be very extensive and long-lived: Rudescu et al. (1965) estimated the age of some clones as in excess of 1000 years. Although seed-set, fertility and viability can be good (e.g. Hürlimann 1951, Bittman 1953, Spence 1964, Haslam 1972zz), conditions are rarely favourable for the growth of seedlings within existing stands, but this may be of little consequence with such an efficient system of vegetative renewal. Phragmites can attain a very high shoot density on healthy advancing fronts (Haslam 1971 a, 1972 a) and retain it within older stands, producing a canopy that, by mid-summer, has reduced light penetration below very substantially (But tery & Lambert 1965, Haslam 1971 a, 1972 a). In deeper water, it has few natural competitors and, on drier ground, an undisturbed litter mat can help prevent the establishment of other species (Haslam 1971 a). Stands which suffer moderate damage from frosting, burning or insect infestation seem to possess an ability to restore a balanced shoot production within a few seasons (Mook & van der Toorn 1982). The essential feature of successful competitors to Phragmites seems to be that they can capitalise on light levels under a given water and nutrient regime. Some achieve this by virtue of a different phenology to reed. Both those swamp helophytes which seem able to com pete with Phragmites in deeper waters, Glyceria maxima and Typha angustifolia, attain maximum shoot densities and a critical light interception by May, when the emergence of reed shoots is only one third or so com plete (Buttery & Lambert 1965, Mason & Bryant 1975). Moreover, G. maxima goes on producing shoots until late in the season and not until the shoots lodge is light penetration increased. Some other species require a drier substrate to invade. Cladium mariscus and Carex paniculata both seem able to take advantage of the period between the emergence of an accumulating Phragmites root felt above the water level and the build-up of litter on the now drier surface (e.g. Lambert 1951). Moreover, both are evergreen and somewhat shade-tolerant and well adapted to survive the gradual depression of the mat of Phragmites under the water with the slowly increasing weight of their bulky stocks. C. mariscus may have the additional advantage of a greater tolerance of oligotrophic con ditions than Phragmites (Lambert 1951). The establishment of most other species within the Phragmitetum depends upon some reduction in reed vigour to open the canopy and an amelioration of the blanketing effect of the accumulating litter mat. There https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.034 Published online by Cambridge University Press148 Swamps and tail-herb fens may be an opportunity for some species to invade in those situations where, with slow terrestrialisation, a still thin litter mat is exposed to decreasing periods of winter submergence with ever shallower waters. The development of the Galium sub-community from the Phragmites sub-community occurs in this way as rela tively shade-tolerant herbs are able to establish on the damp litter in spring. As the reed cover becomes less vigorous on the drier substrate, there may be a continuing natural succession to the richer vegetation of the Phragmites-Eupatorium or Peucedano-Phragmitetum fens and thence to fen carr (e.g. Tansley 1939, Lambert & Jennings 1951, Lambert 1951, Wheeler 1980c). At various stages in such sequences, winter-cropping of reed can help the Phragmitetum persist against the tendency towards invasion of competitors or confuse the natural succession. More drastic disturbance of the water regime or of the litter mat may produce a strong disruption in the natural growth rhythm of Phragmites, giving any invaders a season or more's advantage. The rapid drop in water level consequent upon drainage can produce such results (Haslam 1970c, 197la, b) as can very severe and repeated frost or mismanagement of reed-beds. If there is surface disturbance, eutrophication of oxidising organic matter is often followed by the development of the Phragmites-Urtica community with its very characteristic patches of nitrophilous tall herbs (e.g. Haslam 1965). The enrichment of dyke waters by fertiliser run off and sewage and the disturbance involved in dyke clearance and dredging is often marked by successions to this fen on the banks. On some ungrazed salt-marshes, the Phragmitetum has replaced parts of stands of the Spartinetum towns-endii but the status of the community in general successions of salt-marshes is difficult to assess (Ranwell 1961, 1964ZZ, 1972). Distribution "
"s5","Zonation and succession Extensive, virtually pure stands of the Glyceria sub community are quite common and sometimes com pletely choke small ponds, ox-bows or flat, narrow channels with standing or slow-moving water (Lambert 1947c, Haslam 1978). Frequently, however, the Glycerietum occurs as a definite zone in open-water transitions and riparian sequences, typically passing to the Sparganietum erecti in deeper water and, above, to the Phalaridetum aruncinaceae. Where banks shelve gently, the community may occur in both forms, the Alisma-Sparganium sub-community forming a fragmentary transition to the Sparganietum erecti and giving way above to a belt of the Glyceria sub-community. Such zonations are a very characteristic feature of pools and streams in the English lowlands. In the rather special conditions along the Yare, the Glyceria sub-community often abuts directly on to the open water of the broads as marginal 'hover' or, especially where there is tidal scour, occurs behind a marginal fringe of Phragmitetum australis. Away from the open water, the Glycerietum usually gives way to some kind of fen vegetation in which both G. maxima and P. australis are important components, e.g. the Glyceria sub-community of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum or the Epilobium hirsutum sub-community of the Phragmites-Urtica fen. Although the abundance and vigour of G. maxima in such sequences clearly decline with increased distance from the moving broads water (Lambert 1946, Buttery & Lambert 1965), there does not seem to be a single, simple edaphic gradient related to this change. There seems no doubt, however, that once established under favourable conditions, G. maxima can play a major part in successions from open water to fen. It is capable of rapid growth (Syme 1872, Lambert 1947c), and can readily encroach upon open water provided there is some contact between the vegetation mat and underlying sediments: at the very front of marginal 'hover' where the roots hang free in the water, there is a small reduction in growth and detached islands of Glycerietum quickly become chlorotic if they do not make renewed contact with the substrate (Buttery & Lambert 1965). In sluggish streams, in dykes and in pools, G. maxima litter may accumulate in stagnant conditions and aid terrestrialisation. On the Yare, the Glycerietum often initiates succession in more sheltered but irrigated situations (Lambert 1946). Here G. maxima seems to have a competitive edge over P. australis. These species have broadly similar upper limits of growth in relation to water level and both are tolerant, though by virtue of different growth habits, of the tidal rise and fall. G. maxima, however, begins growth earlier from shoots which in the previous autumn have already extended up to substrate level (Lambert 1947c) and the expanding leafy shoots rapidly reduce light penetration below (Buttery & Lambert 1965). There is thus a dense cover of vegetation even before the shoots of P. australis, with its deep-seated rhizomes and perennating buds, break the surface. Where mixed stands are mown early, G. max ima, with its good growth of aftermath, has the addi tional advantage of quick recovery over P. australis which, though starting later, produces a single flush of shoots and attains its standing crop maximum earlier. Where conditions begin to isolate growing Glycerietum on the Yare from the irrigating waters, its productivity has been shown to decline (Buttery & Lambert 1965). This isolation may happen by continued extension of the community into open water with slow peat accumulation towards the fen hinterland or within the relic arms of broads and in dykes which become blocked (Lambert 1946). It has been shown that, as G. maxima becomes, for some reason, unable to utilise available major nutrients, which may not themselves be externally limiting, P. australis can gain the ascendant because of some greater ability to tolerate conditions generally unfavourable to both species (Buttery & Lambert 1965). Like the other Broadland seres, the successions involving the Glycerietum are more complex than at first sight. Alongside streams and rivers, the accumulation of substrate beneath the Glycerietum seems more dependent upon silting than on the build-up of litter (cf. Tansley 1939). Winter floods readily wash away the G. maxima remains (Lambert 1947c) and the repeated disturbance of the mineral material itself may continually set back any successional advance of the community which maintains itself as a permanent fringe. Distribution "
"s6","Zonation and succession The community often forms part of riparian sequences which frequently terminate abruptly above in agricultural boundaries. Stands within wet woodlands may pass gradually to the surrounding vegetation with the C. riparia remaining a prominent component of the field layer. Distribution "
"s7","Zonation and succession Around more extensive open-water transitions, the community may form swamp which passes gradually to fen in which C. acutiformis remains a prominent component, e.g. some forms of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum, and it was from such situations that Lambert (1951) described her C. acutiformis sere along the Bure valley in Norfolk. At more abrupt water margins, the community occurs in often narrow and fragmentary transitions with the Sparganietum erecti towards deeper and, to land ward, the Glycerietum maximae or Phragmitetum aus tralis. Unlike the Caricetum ripariae, this community may also form swampy patches in calcareous floodmeadows and flood-pastures, passing gradually through some form of Calthion community to damp mesotro-phic grassland, but, with agricultural improvement, such transitions are becoming more rare. C. acutiformis seems to be quite an aggressive species which may be able to readily invade riverside fields where drains become blocked. It also appears to be able to tolerate cattle grazing (Wheeler 1975). Distribution "
"s8","Zonation and succession The Scirpetum lacustris represents the deep-water limit of swamp vegetation in Britain and stands may be isolated beyond the more proximal parts of emergent sequences. In larger lakes, where the community is represented by the Scirpus or, in shallower water, the Equisetum sub-community, extensive stretches of open water may occur between the community and inshore swamps. In Scottish lakes, Spence (1964) commonly encountered mixtures of submerged Juncus bulbosus (i.e. J. fluitans Lam.) and Littorella uniflora in this intervening zone and often running out to form, with Sparganium minimum, a distinctive understorey to the Scirpetum. In other cases, the community gave way, in shallower water, to Phragmitetum australis, sometimes with a narrow zone of overlap between the two vegetation types. An essentially similar zonation occurs at Esthwaite in Cumbria (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wilson 1978). It is clear that, at North Fen at Esthwaite, the Scirpetum advanced some 15-30 m into open water between 1915 and 1929 (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939) and, along part of its front, about half this distance between 1929 and 1967 (Pigott & Wilson 1978), giving rates of movement between about 0.5 and 2 m yr -1. At other sites, however, stands have remained more or less unaltered and stationary for at least 50 years (West 1905, Spence 1964: cf. Plates 70 & 71 in Spence 1964) and S. lacustris ssp. lacustris may itself be of little importance in terrestrialisation. In rivers and streams, small and fragmentary stands of the Scirpus sub-community may stand some distance out from the banks in deeper water. On more steeply shelving profiles, the Sparganium sub-community may form part of a narrow transition from open water, through the Sparganietum erecti to the Glycerietum maximae or some form of tail-herb vegetation (Haslam 1978). Distribution "
"s9","Zonation and succession Sometimes, especially in the more oligotrophic upland lakes, the community represents the limit of swamp vegetation. Frequently, however, it occurs behind a front of the Scirpetum lacustris and/or Phragmitetum australis. The two sub-communities are themselves com monly zoned, with the Carex sub-community extending https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.039 Published online by Cambridge University PressS9 Caricetum rostratae swamp 167 out into deeper water and giving way behind to the Menyanthes-Equisetum sub-community. This may grade laterally to the C. rostrata sub-community of the Equisetetum fluviatile with a switch in dominance to E. fluviatile and, in shallower water around some Scottish lakes, to the Caricetum vesicariae in which C. vesicaria is dominant with many of the same associates. In some cases, this kind of transition continues above in a gradual switch to the Potentillo-Caricetum with an increase in poor-fen herbs and larger Calliergonspp-(see also Matthews 1914) and there seems little doubt that this represents a standard kind of succession in fairly base-poor waters over organic substrates. Sometimes, however, this kind of smooth zonation is complicated by local variation in water throughput and enrichment around inflows and along seepage lines. Then, the Caricetum may be part of a complex patchwork of poor fens in which C. rostrata remains prominent but where the understorey varies in response to an increase in calcium and base-status, as in the C. rostrata-Sphagnum squarrosum community and certain types of Carex r os tr at a-Callier gon mire vegetation. This kind of rich local variation has been well described from some basin mires on Carboniferous Limestone, such as Malham Tarn in North Yorkshire (Proctor 1974, Adam et al. 1975) and Sunbiggin Tarn, Cumbria (Holdgate 1955b). It is also seen at the margins of some of the Scottish lakes (Spence 1964). In such situations, other sedges such as C. lasiocarpa and C. aquatilis may attain local prominence in standing water alongside C. rostrata. Where the Caricetum rostratae occurs in pools within non-calcareous basin mires or in peat cuttings in ombro-genous mires, it may grade to the more oligotrophic vegetation of the C. rostrata-Sphagnum recurvum community of the stagnant bog-pool margins.Distribution "
"sd1","Zonation and succession The Rumex-Glaucium community is sometimes the only vegetation to be seen on shingle beaches, forming an open zone isolated from the hinterland of the shore, where dune or inland communities sometimes occur, but where there is often now a sharp boundary with agricul-tural land or settlements, frequently behind sea-defences. With a shift to less stable conditions, however, or where lines of drift are deposited on the beach, the Rumex-Glaucium community can pass to annual strand-line assemblages, and on wider shores there can be gra-dations to vegetation of more consolidated beachsubstrates, either grasslands on shingle or dune commu-nities. Where shingle accumulation is progressive, such zonations may represent a succession, but usually the Rumex-Glaucium community persists as a perpetually renewed pioneer vegetation. Throughout the range of the community, the asso-ciated strandline vegetation is commonly of the Atriplex-Beta type, an assemblage typically found as strips on lines of decaying wrack and other detritus deposited at the tidal limits. G flavum and Crambe are sometimes recorded among such vegetation on shingle, and R. crispus var. littoreus remains quite common, but it is Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima and various Atriplex spp., together with Matricaria maritima, that provide much of its distinctive character. Such assemblages may come and go along the strandlines in successive seasons, or replace the Rumex-Glaucium community where stretches of beach do not remain stable from one year to the next. Sandier strandlines can see transitions from the shingle vegetation to the Honkenya-Cakile community. Here, again, Atriplex spp. are very common, and often locally abundant, and these, together with occasional R. crispus var. littoreus, B. vulgaris ssp. maritima and Silene vulgaris ssp. maritima, can provide some floristic conti-nuity with the Rumex-Glaucium community, but it is patches of Honkenya peploides, with Cakile maritima and Salsola kali, that usually mark out the broken strips of this vegetation that develop at extreme high water mark. Local accumulations of sand around the patches are prone to invasion by Elymusfarctus, Leymus arenar-ius and Ammophila arenaria, and this can initiate a tem-porary or progressive succession to fore-dunes. A very few sites, notably the beaches of north Norfolk, show a patchy but complete zonation from Typical Rumex-Glaucium vegetation, through the Honkenya-Cakile community and Elymus fore-dunes, to Ammophila vege-tation of varying degrees of maturity (Oliver 1913,1915, Ratcliffe 1977). In other places around the coast of east and southern England, where there is an increase in the stability and shelter of the shingle habitat, without any marked accumulation of wind-blown sand, the Typical form of the Rumex-Glaucium vegetation can pass landwards to the Lathyrus sub-community, and this in turn gives way to some distinctive grasslands in which dominance passes to Arrhenatherum, Festuca rubra and Silene vulgaris ssp. maritima, with an almost total occlusion of shinglehemicryptophytes. Orford Ness and Dungeness show the best development of this Arrhenatherum-Silene com-munity with, in the latter site, zonations to non-maritime Arrhenatheretum and uniquely extensive mosaics on compacted sandy shingle with Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex calcifugous grassland and scrub dominated by Cytisusscoparius. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.035 Published online by Cambridge University Press132 Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities Another species which, very locally around the south-east coast, assumes prominence on sheltered shingle, especially on the leeward site of spits, is Suaeda vera. Its water-borne seed germinates very readily on accumula-tions of drift, the plants soon anchoring firmly with deep tap roots and then growing from shoots held horizontally under the pebbles, spreading outwards or extending in a single direction as shingle is shifted over the bushes. On Chesil Beach, for example, a patchy zone of open Elymo-Suaedetum, dominated by S. vera, replaces the Rumex-Glaucium community along the landward side of the bar, with its complex of fans and flats looking out over The Fleet (Oliver 1912, Tansley 1939). And, at Blakeney Point in Norfolk, this kind of vegetation runs around the drift-line of the sheltered embayments between the shingle laterals, replacing the Rumex-Glaucium commu-nity in the narrow strip that forms a transition on sandy pebbles from the dunes of the spit to the salt-marsh behind (Oliver 1913, Oliver & Salisbury 1913a, b). Distribution "
"sd10","Zonation and succession The Carex arenaria community is generally found as a minor element among zonations and mosaics of other vegetation types of coastal and inland sands, interrupt-ing the patterns wherever the sedge has been able to cap-italise on local deposition in sheltered places. It is replaced by other communities as more aggressive plants are able to dominate on still mobile sand or where, with increased stability of the surface, the vigour of the sedge wanes. Grazing may influence these successional changes or help bring about a renewed round of invasion on newly-disturbed ground. On coastal sites, the F. rubra sub-community is some-times found invading areas of sand among foredunes where the Elymus farctus community is the predominant colonising vegetation, but more often it appears among Ammophila and Ammophila-Festuca stands on some-what older mobile dunes, where marram has not yet asserted, or reasserted, its dominance. Boundaries between the vegetation types in these patterns are marked by shifts in the proportions of the monocotyle-dons, although Ammophila can be quite common and abundant among developing Carex vegetation, while the sedge persists frequently, though never as more than asub-dominant, in the Carex sub-community of Ammo-phila vegetation and in certain kinds of Ammophila-Festuca sward. The scattered occurrence throughout of associates like F. rubra and S. jacobaea can also accentu-ate the continuity among the vegetation cover. Where accretion is rapid, Ammophila readily assumes dominance over the sedge with a succession to these other communities in a resumption of the main trend of development, although local deposition of sand in shel-tered spots among the dunes and around blow-outs which subsequently form can favour a resurgence of https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.044 Published online by Cambridge University PressSD10 Carex arenaria dune community 197 Carex vegetation. Indeed, such a return to this pioneer community is possible among stretches of fixed dunes where the Festuca-Galium vegetation is often the succes-sor to the Ammophila-Festuca community where the sands remain calcareous. C. arenaria is a common asso-ciate in the sward and may be quick to take advantage of accretion, especially where Ammophila has become very debilitated. Boundaries are generally sharp in such situ-ations, though the margins of the Festuca-Galium turf may become fretted away by wind erosion or animal dis-turbance or blurred by a thin overlay of sand and, if the surface becomes stabilised once again, the richer sward can re-establish itself around the margins or among the Carex vegetation. In certain situations, however, it seems as if the sedge community can remain in long occupation of fixed dunes, as on Blakeney where, with the disappearance of rabbits in the myxomatosis epidemic, C. arenaria attained a dominance that has not been readily challenged by F rubra (White 1961). Among coastal dunes built of more acidic sands, or where the surface has become strongly leached with time, the patterns are somewhat different. If accretion proceeds at a fairly modest rate, and especially where the sand is sufficiently acidic from the outset to inhibit the vigour of marram (Huiskes 1979), the sedge may play amore prominent role throughout the succession. Then, especially where the vegetation is grazed, the Carex community can give way to the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis or Carex-Cornicularia swards. In the former, mixtures of C. arenaria and smaller grasses usually dominate, with such Ammophila as is present often sparse andpuny, and the early appearance among the developing sedge cover of plants like Agrostis capillaris, H. lanatus, R lanceolata and Achillea millefolium, may make the boundaries between the vegetation types indistinct. Generally, however, high frequencies of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Luzula campestris and Galium saxatile char-acterise the later stages of sward development, together with the appearance of a variety of calcifuge bryophytes that hardly ever find a place on the still mobile sand. In other situations, perhaps where heavy rabbit grazing has played an important role in influencing the succession,the Carex-Cornicularia community can occupy much of the more stable sand surface. Here, again, the sedge retains a frequent and often abundant place in the vege-tation, commonly with some F. rubra and sparse marram, but Rumex acetosella and a variety of diminu-tive ephemerals now appear and there is typically anextensive carpet of lichens, with Cornicularia aculeata and a variety of Cladonia spp. particularly prominent. Where either of these swards becomes disrupted with degeneration and wind erosion, the Carex community can reappear on drifts of accumulated sand. A striking feature of some sites with this kind of pattern, as at Winterton, is the prominence, early in the successionand re-seeding for a few years within the more close turf, of Corynephorus (Marshall 1967). It is mixtures of grassy and lichen-rich swards that make up much of the vegetation context for the develop-ment of inland stands of the Carex community. Away from the coast, tracts of mobile sand are very localisedthough, in regions like Breckland, wind erosion of sandy soils has played an important part in the evolution of the landscape. Here, blow-outs have been observed forming (Watt 1937) as a result of the action of local cyclonic winds on degenerating Calluna-Festuca heath, Carex-Cornicularia or Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grasslands on sand-smeared podzols. Where these have become reduced to a mat of humus or a scabby carpet of lichens among decaying grass shoots, the surface is readily dis-rupted by the impact of sun, rain and wind, the sand accumulating in low dunes around the developing hollow or being blown away in shallow drifts by frontal erosion. It is on this newly-accreted material that the F. ovina sub-community of the Carex vegetation is able to get a hold, sometimes persisting for a considerable time in its impoverished form, in other places grading backinto grazed swards. Then, the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis or Carex-Cornicularia communities may form a transition to the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland, the contribu-tion of the sedge waning, and dominance passing to small tussock grasses, ephemerals and patches of lichens and bryophytes. Very occasionally in these fine mosaics, where there is a transition to less sandy soils of higher pH, the Carex community can be closely juxtaposed with the more basiphilous of the Breckland grassheaths of the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus type (Watt 1940, Noble 1982). On shallower, stabilising drifts of sand where there is little or no grazing, an alternative successional develop-ment is the reappearance of heath, because in such con-ditions Calluna is an important competitor to C arenaria (Watt 1936,1937). On Breckland sands, it is the Calluna-Festuca community that is the usual kind of sub-shrub vegetation and its Carex sub-community, with co-dominant mixtures of heather and sedge, can form a transitional zone in shifts from more to less mobile substrates (Tidmarsh 1939, Gibbons 1975). C. arenaria also remains a constant feature of many stands of heath which develop on the more stable, acid sands of ungrazed or lightly-grazed coastal dunes. Around parts of the East Anglian coast, Calluna-Festuca heath indis-tinguishable from that inland can be found in such situa-tions but, elsewhere, Calluna-Carex heath is the usual community, with Erica cinerea or, much more locally, Empetrum nigrum spp. nigrum, invading along with the heather. Such heaths are sometimes subject to burningto regenerate the sub-shrub cover, and such treatment may help stimulate flowering among ageing C. arenaria (Tidmarsh 1939). https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.044 Published online by Cambridge University Press198 Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities A further complication of such patterns is the appear-ance of Pteridium aquilinum, because the sedge and bracken are both able to spread rapidly on loose and deep, well-aerated substrates and, in both inland and coastal sites, the Carex community can be found in intimate association with bracken vegetation, thebalance between the dominants along the boundaries being related to the cyclical upbuilding and ageing of the Pteridium along its front (Watt 1936, 1940; Tidmarsh 1939). More mature stands of bracken in such patterns on acid sands tend to be of the Pteridium-Galium type, with Pteridium-Rubus underscrub developing on less base-poor and impoverished substrates. Distribution "
"sd11","Zonation and succession The Car ex-Cornicularia community is commonly found as a minor element in mosaics with calcifuge grasslands and heaths on the subdued topography of older dunes and sand plains. On siliceous sediments, these vegetationtypes may represent late stages in a distinctive line of succession, but they also develop where calcareous sands have been long-leached and may then occur among less mature and more basiphilous dune commu-nities, particularly in coastal sites. This vegetation can also be part of secondary cycles of succession related to renewed erosion and is probably often dependent for its continuing survival on heavy grazing, particularly by rabbits. Where this is relieved, the community probablygives way to heath or, where the ground is less impover-ished, to scrub and woodland. In the heart of its distribution in East Anglia, the Car ex-Cornicularia vegetation often occurs, at both coastal and inland sites, with the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland which, apart from the scarcity of C arenaria can be very similar in its physiognomy and com-position. In the Cornicularia-Cladonia sub-community of the grassland, for example, Cornicularia aculeata, Cladonia arbuscula, C. tenuis, C impexa, C foliacea, C. uncialis and C furcata all remain frequent and abun-dant, with D. scoparium, P. piliferum and R. acetosella, among an open tussocky turf of F. ovina and A. capil-laris. Transitions of this kind may reflect increasingstability of the surface, with the final extinction of the sand sedge, while in more scuffed and disturbed places,as along path edges, the Car ex-Cornicularia community may give way to the Erodium-Teesdalia sub-community of the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland with its richand varied suite of ephemerals. Gross disruption of the swards in such mosaics may result in erosion of the sand, with the development of blow-outs and tracts of freshly-deposited sediment (Watt 1938) and then there is anopportunity for renewed invasion by the sand sedge from rhizome fragments or by seed (Noble 1982),remnant stretches of sward occurring among young stands of the Carex community. Where the surface of such siliceous sands becomes quickly stable once again, the sedge decreasing in vigour and the spread of other perennials being restricted by inhospitable soil condi-tions, it is possible that the Carex-Cornicularia commu-nity re-establishes itself fairly quickly (Watt 1938) and this may represent a natural sequence on such base-poor sediments. In contrast to such situations in The Netherlands (Westhoff & den Held 1969), Germany (Oberdorfer 1978, Ellenberg 1978) and Poland (Matusz-kiewicz 1981), however, Corynephorus plays a very restricted role with us in the earlier stages, being an important colonist at just a few coastal sites (Marshall 1967) and remaining now at only a single inland station (Trist 1979). On sands which were initially more calcareous, as in many coastal dune systems, the persistence of Ammo-phila is a reminder that the Carex-Cornicularia commu-nity may represent a late stage in a rather different successional sequence, with marram playing the major https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.045 Published online by Cambridge University PressSD11 Carex arenaria-Cornicularia aculeata dune community 205 role in fixing the sediments before they become stable and leached. In such situations, the Carex-Cornicularia community can be found among older dunes, sometimes again with Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex swards or among stretches of Festuca-Galium grassland, particularly where the sands have not been so strongly decalcified. In the Luzula sub-community of such grassland, plants like F. ovina, L. campestris and H. radicata remain frequent in a turf with senile Ammophila and sometimes sparse C arenaria, and where the Carex-Cornicularia community extends into eastern Scotland, Astragalus danicus can occur throughout the zonation. Increasingly, however, with the shift to the wetter and cooler part of Britain, the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grassland becomes important as a transition between parched calcifuge swards of the Carex-Cornicularia type and the more closed grasslands of fixed dune sands. Then, such fragments of the formeras remain, grade almost imperceptibly through a thick-ening turf into Festuca-Galium vegetation, species such as Poa pratensis, A. capillaris, F. rubra, Galium verumand Lotus corniculatus becoming increasingly impor-tant, and bryophytes occluding lichens as the major cryptogamic element. Grazing is an important factor in maintaining mosaics of these different grasslands and some sites now betray ample evidence of the demise of rabbits or the cessation of sheep pasturing with an increase in size of the grass tussocks and a disappearance of the species demanding of open ground. A spread of Calluna is also very likely in such situations, the vegetation becoming increasingly heathy as the bushes multiply and enlarge. In East Anglia, such succession is usually to the Calluna-Festuca heath, among certain types of which Carex aren-aria and lichens remain very frequent and patchily abundant. Where the climate is not so strongly continen-tal, Calluna-Carex heath often develops from calcifuge dune grasslands, Erica cinerea being a common asso-ciate among lichen-rich vegetation with frequent C. arenaria, F ovina, L. campestris and A. praecox. Dis-turbed and enriched ground may have patches of Ulex-Rubus scrub with fragments of calcifuge sward persist-ing among the gorse bushes, while deep, loose sands can support dense Pteridium-Galium vegetation. Invasion of birch or pine may presage a development to some kind of Quercion woodland, typically, in the heart of the range of the Carex-Cornicularia community, of the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia type.

"sd12","Zonation and succession The Carex-Festuca-Agrostis community is typically found in zonations and mosaics with other grasslands and heath on the fixed sands of the hinterland of coastal dunes and sand plains, where the vegetation patterns are primarily determined by edaphic variation and differ-ences in treatment. Relaxation of grazing mediates a succession to heath or woodland, but most stands are maintained by continuing use as pasture for stock. Where stretches of fixed dunes have been reclaimed formore intensive agricultural use or for forestry or amenity purposes, the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grassland may survive more fragmentarily among improved swards orarable land, plantations or golf-course greens. Among the other kinds of grassland found on fixed sands, the community is most often seen with some type of Festuca-Galium vegetation, grading to this where the ground is more base-rich, with substrates of shell-sandthat is not so strongly leached or periodically renewed by very modest accretion. Species like C arenaria, fescues and P. pratensis continue to provide much of the cover in a fairly short sward with just scattered tufts of Ammo-phila, but F rubra generally exceeds F ovina, and there is usually a more consistent occurrence of G. verum, P. lan-ceolata, T. repens, L. corniculatus and A. millefolium. In the Luzula sub-community, however, L. campestris, A. capillaris, F ovina and Anthoxanthum become quite common and this sort of Festuca-Galium sward may pass imperceptibly to the Anthoxanthum sub-commu-nity of the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grassland where there are gentle shifts in the base-richness of the sands. On somewhat moister and less impoverished ground, the Holcus sub-community of the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grassland may grade to the Prunella type of Festuca-Galium sward. Where the sand retains a greater degree of mobility with the move on to younger dunes, the Festuca-Galium grassland passes in turn to Ammophila-Festuca vegeta-tion, where marram is still vigorous on the upbuilding surface and where the associates make up an often patchy cover between the tussocks. Sometimes, the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grassland itself gives way to the Ammophila-Festuca community in places where the sand has become mobile again with disturbance of the surface, but more often, and particularly where the sands are acidic, it is the Carex arenaria community that is the secondary colonising vegetation. In that vegetation, the https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.046 Published online by Cambridge University PressSD12 Carex arenaria-Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris dune grassland 211 cover can be much more open at first, with rejuvenated C. arenaria extending its rhizomes out through the loose sand, but the sedge may thicken up in time, and other associates appear, with tussocks of the fescues and scat-tered R acetosella and R lanceolata providing a measure of continuity with the more intact swards around. Indeed, on base-poor sands, this kind of invasion may be the natural line of primary succession that leads eventu-ally to the development of Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grass-land. On coasts in warmer and drier parts of Britain, and more locally elsewhere, the community can also be found on acidic sands with the Carex-Cornicularia vege-tation. In that assemblage, the sedge cover thins and the perennial grasses are reduced to scattered tussocks, with just occasional rosette herbs and patches of chamae-phytes and, very strikingly, a switch to lichens rather than pleurocarps as the dominant cryptogams. Such a change can be associated with concentrated rabbit activ-ity, but exposure to parching on sunnier dune slopes may also favour the development of the Carex-Cornicularia community on old erosion surfaces that have compacted and impoverished sands. Both the Carex-Cornicularia and especially the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis community are prone to invasion by Calluna and other ericoids where grazing is lax. In drier parts of the country, where both these vegetation typescan contribute to the swards on fixed acid sands, colon-isation by heather usually leads to the development ofthe Calluna-Festuca heath, where C. arenaria can remain locally prominent with F. ovina and occasional A. capil-laris, G. saxatile and R acetosella, along with D. scopar-ium and H. cupressiforme in the ground carpet. Erica cinerea may also occur in such heath in East Anglia, but this plant becomes much more common in northern and western localities where the Calluna-Carex heath is the usual kind of dune ericoid vegetation. Here again, mix-tures of sub-shrubs, C. arenaria and F. ovina provide a diagnostic element, but L. campestris, Anthoxanthum and various bryophytes give greater floristic continuity with the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grassland. In this type of dune heath in eastern Scotland, Empetrum nigrum tends to replace E. cinerea as the associated sub-shrub. Quite often, where grazing has fluctuated in intensity complex mosaics of heath and grassland occur on pas-tured dunes, the expansion of the sub-shrubs within the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis community being held or pushed back by renewed predation by stock. Elsewhere,neglect has allowed the development of leggy heather which excludes virtually all associates until it begins to degenerate. Or, where seedling shrubs and trees get away, there may be transitions to scrub or woodland, withbirch and pine, more locally oak, leading a succession to Quercion vegetation. Then, there may be patches of the Pteridium-Galium community where bracken has pre-empted the spread of heather in the grassland or shaded it out, with Ulex-Rubus scrub marking places that have been disturbed or enriched. Fragments of all these may survive, along with patches of the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis vegetation, around plantations on dunes, infield corners of improved pastures and on golf-course rough. Distribution "
"sd13","Zonation and succession The Sagina-Bryum community is a very local vegetation type representing early or repeatedly-renewed stages in the colonisation of young, only briefly-wetted slacks among stabilised dune ridges. It can be found in systems with more mature and drier slacks and with more summer-damp slacks according to the pattern of ground-water fluctuation and gives way on drier dune ridges to a range of fixed grasslands. A combination of drying and freedom from grazing can facilitate eventual development of wet scrubby woodland. Damper slacks on similar base-rich dunes to those with the Sagina-Bryum community can have stands of the Salix-Campy Hum community or, where older slacks are kept very wet and have a more vigorous shading canopy of Salix repens, stretches of Salix-Colliergon vegetation. Generally speaking, such slacks are separ-ated by ridges carrying Festuca-Galium grassland or where there is still some measure of sand movement, the more stable types of Ammophila-Festuca grassland. To these, the Sagina-Bryum vegetation can grade through the Holcus-Festuca sub-community, the grass cover thickening up, Ammophila becoming somewhat more vigorous and ephemerals and less competitive bryo-phytes being crowded out. Drier slack vegetation of the Salix-Holcus type may occur as a transitional zone in such sequences. As slacks with the Sagina-Bryum community age and dry, a process assisted by trapping of sand among the Salix repens, this vegetation is probably succeeded by the Salix-Holcus community which in turn may be invaded by shrubs and trees, as in its Ononis sub-community. Hippophae rhamnoides always has the potential to super-vene in such serai progressions. Distribution "
"sd14","Zonation and succession The Salix-Campylium community typically occupies slacks of moderate wetness in systems with a range ofground-water conditions, generally between ridges with various Festuca-Galium or Ammophila-Festuca swards. It is probably maintained by continuing winter flooding but any tendency to drying is marked by eventual pro-gression to woodland. Within individual slacks, depressions of natural or artificial origin where the moss carpet is opened up, can have local stands of the Bryum-Aneura sub-community among other kinds of Salix-Campylium vegetation. Drier stands can pass to the Salix-Holcus community ordirectly to Festuca-Galium swards on the dune-ridges around, a generally sharp shift with the change in ground moisture conditions. Successional change within the community sees the Bryum-Aneura type giving way to other sub-communi-ties and, in this process, the development of a tussock habit in Equisetum variegatum may play a distinctive part in the two or three decades it can take for Salix repens to form a dominant canopy (Hope-Simpson & Yemm 1979). As tussocks grow and fuse, creeping and stoloniferous species infilling any remaining spaces, itseems that the surface of the vegetation mat elevates perhaps several decimetres (Jones 1992). Distribution "
"sd15","Zonation and succession The Salix-Calliergon community typically occupies older and wetter slacks among stabilised dune systems, quite commonly with other types of slack vegetation in younger and drier hollows disposed according to the age of the dune ridges and the variation in the water-table(Figure 16). Transitions to surrounding dune grasslands depend on the configuration of the slacks and ridges. The high water-table and extensive moss carpet of thisvegetation inhibit colonisation by shrubs and trees but, in drier conditions, grazing by stock and rabbits may also be important in setting back succession. Where there is variation in hydrological conditions within individual large slacks, different types of Salix-Calliergon vegetation can be found in close proximity, grading the one into the other. Sometimes, too, where conditions become somewhat drier, this kind of slack assemblage can grade through the Equisetum sub-com-munity to the Carex flacca sub-community of the Poten-til la-Carex slack. In the opposite direction, where slacks contain stretches of permanent open water, the Holcus-Angelicasub-community can pass to some kind of Phragmites-Eupatorium fen, Phragmites swamp or the Eleocharit-etum palustris, more particularly the Littorella sub-community. The Salix-Calliergon community seems characteristic of late stages in succession (van der Laan 1979): at Kenfig Jones (1992) noted that stands appeared to have taken many years to develop and had not changed noticeably in 8 years. Where the ground continues to be flooded for considerable periods, it seems likely that this kind of veg-etation might have some stability. However, where woody plants do get a hold, it is generally Salix cinerea, S. caprea and Betula pubescens that colonise first, giving rise to some type of Salix-Betula-Phragmites or Salix-Galium woodland. In some sites, patches of these can be seen among stands of Salix-Calliergon vegetation. Distribution "
"sd16","Zonation and succession The Salix-Holcus community is a widespread type of slack vegetation occupying the older dry slacks in largeand complex dune systems and sometimes comprising the bulk of cover between stable dune ridges. Through the Agrostis and Poa sub-communities, it can grade to wetter slack vegetation in areas where the water-table breaches the surface in winter but often it occupies theentire area of individual slacks, the most obvious zonations being to the Festuca-Galium grassland on grazed dune ridges. With the shift to drier ground, the dominance of Salix repens declines and a mixture of grasses and smaller dicotyledons assumes dominance. Where the Prunella-Equisetum sub-community of the Salix-Holcus slack gives way to the Prunella type of Festuca-Holcus sward or the Ononis and Rubus sub-communities of the former pass to Typical Festuca-Holcus grassland, the shift can be quite gradual apart from the loss of Salix repens. Where grazing is less intensive, the Salix-Holcus slack can give way to Ammophila-Arrhenatherum grass-land.The Salix-Holcus community is a later stage in the development of slack vegetation, probably succeeding the Sagina-Bryum vegetation quite quickly where inundation ceases, replacing wetter slack communities more slowly as the surface dries. The lowering of the ground water table can play an obvious part in such a process but trapping of sand by S. repens and upbuilding of a mat upon which grasses can root may also be important. Where the canopy is a little more open, invasion of bushy Salix spp. and Betula pubescens can initiate the development of woodland. Where Hippophae occurs locally, it can supervene in such successions. Distribution "
"sd17","Zonation and succession Among complexes of dune slacks, the Potentilla-Carex community occupies wetter and less base-rich hollows,where there can be considerable fluctuations in ground water levels, generally among stable dune ridges with fixed grasslands. Repeated substantial inundation help maintain the community but where drying conditions combine with a reduction in grazing, this vegetation canbe readily invaded by shrubs and trees. Shifts from the Potentilla-Carex community to the Festuca-Galium grassland, which provides its usual context, can be quite sharp where there is a markedchange in slope and ground water levels on the sur-rounding dune ridges. Often, however, particularly onthe sand-plains of north-west Scotland where this kind of slack vegetation is especially common, the shifts are gradual. Then, the Carex flacca sub-community of thePotentilla-Carex vegetation can pass gently to the Pru-nella sub-community of the Festuca-Galium grassland over undulating machair whose whole patchwork ofswards is used for extensive pasturing. Very commonly, too, in Scotland, the Potentilla-Carex community forms part of a continuum with wetter grasslands to the vegetation of swamps and mires (Dargie 1993). Then it is particularly the Caltha and Hydrocotyle-Ranunculus sub-communities that play a prominent role, the latter often passing to the Eleochari-tetum swamp in open waters with Phragmitetum more locally. The Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla grassland and something like the Caltha-Cynosurus pasture can figure with the former, though data accumulated since theNVC suggests the existence of undescribed assemblages of this general type in which Carex nigra continues to play a prominent role (Dargie 1993). Where stagnation of less base-rich waters occurs in the wetter hollows of dune systems in northern Britain, peat can accumulate and sustain wet heath of the Scirpus-Erica or Erica-Sphagnum types. With these veg-etation types, the Potentilla-Carex community can form complex mosaics and transitions. Distribution "
"sd18","Zonation and succession The Hippophae community is usually found in mosaics with dune grasslands, weedy tall-herb vegetation and other kinds of scrub developed over less heavily grazed stretches of fixed sands. It develops as a part of natural successions in its east coast localities, elsewhere as an introduction, and, where it is not overtopped, it couldperhaps have a measure of stability in more exposedhabitats. However, many of our stands are too young for us to know what the end product of this succession might be. Although Hippophae scrub can extend on to quite mobile sands carrying the Ammophila community, it is commonly seen among Ammophila-Festuca vegetation on somewhat more stable sediments. Then, there can be a continuous gradation between the Festuca sub-com-munity of the scrub and the dune swards around, mix-tures of Ammophila, F. rubra and R pratensis assuming dominance away from the buckthorn bushes. Leymus can be prominent in the dune vegetation, too, and at some localities along the Lincolnshire and Norfolk coasts, there is a local abundance of Elymus pycnanthusthroughout the zonation. Where the Hippophae cover thickens, the Festuca sub-community can then give way to the Urtica-Arrhenatherum sub-community. In certain sites, this basic pattern is complicated by the occurrence of Ammophila-Arrhenatherum grassland, the Arrhenatherum sub-community of which can grade into both the Ammophila-Festuca dune vegetation with the disappearance of Arrhenatherum, Dactylis glomer-ata, Heracleum and Cirsium arvense or into denserpatches of scrub with the appearance of clumps of Urtica and tangles of G aparine and Solanum. The Arrhenatherion plants may also provide continuity with stands of Rubus-Holcus underscrub where brambles dominate among mixtures of rank grasses and weedy herbs, or there may be stands of tall-herb vegetationdominated by Urtica or Epilobium angustifolium. Then, locally, the occasional bushes of Sambucus seen among the Hippophae may thicken up with transitions to Crataegus-Hedera or Prunus-Rubus scrub from among which the buckthorn is eventually shaded out. With time and shelter from winds, it is possible that such scrub on dunes progresses to Carpinion woodland but even our Hippophae scrub still seems to be in an immature state compared with, for example, Dutch stands and we havelittle information about what the natural successions beyond buckthorn stands might be.

Where local disturbance becomes more acute, however, for example where rabbit activity loosens the sand surface, there can be renewed erosion and a spread of Carex arenaria or Ammophila vegetation which rapidly overwhelms the Tortulo-Phleetum. Distribution "
"sd2","Zonation and succession Along some stretches of shore, the Honkenya-Cakile community is the only kind of maritime vegetation to be seen above the tidal limit, but elsewhere it occurs in zonations with other sand and shingle communities, the patterns being strongly dependent on the deposition and erosion of beach material of different grades, and thefrequency of addition of organic detritus. Most existing stands can be regarded as perpetually renewed pioneer vegetation, although where opportunity arises, the pro-gressive accumulation of sand over and around the com-munity can initiate a dune succession. On beaches that are naturally narrow, or where the shore hinterland has become occupied by settlements or converted to agricultural or recreational use, often behind some sort of sea defence, the Honkenya-Cakile community can occur isolated as a narrow open zone of vegetation just above the tidal limit. In such situations, stands may be very fragmentary and, along any onestretch of beach, not very long-lived, with the additional threat of trampling where beach use is heavy. Even here, however, there can be considerable floristic differences between and along stands, particularly in the varying development of the summer annuals, with species such as P. oxyspermum ssp. raii and A. glabriuscula giving some https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.036 Published online by Cambridge University Press138 Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities measure of regional contrast. And, where there is a shift from sand to coarser shingle in moving along beaches, a common feature where longshore drift operates on extensive lengths of coast, the community can give wayto other kinds of strandline vegetation. In southern Britain, its counterpart on drift-enriched pebbles is the Atriplex-Beta community, where Atriplex spp., particu-larly in this case A. prostrata, remain common and abun-dant, but where Cakile and Honkenya are much reduced in frequency, B. vulgaris ssp. maritima and Matricaria maritima greatly increased. To the north, along sheltered shingly strandlines in Scotland, there is an analogousswitch to the Matricaria-Galium community, with A. glabriuscula this time providing some floristic similarity, but where M. maritima, Galium aparine and Stellaria media become a more or less constant feature. Where a sandy beach top runs along the front of shingle deposits that are beyond the reach of all but very extreme tides, the Honkenya-Cakile community can be replaced by open Rumex-Glaucium vegetation. There, Honkenya can persist with some vigour on sandy patches, its stolons sometimes burrowing down into theunderlying pebbles (Tansley 1939) and Atriplex spp. may thrive on local accumulations of organic detritus, but itis coarse perennial hemicryptophytes like R. crispus var. littoreus, Glaucium and Crambe that provide most of the character of the shingle assemblage. In other places, a shingle spine or low hinterland behind a beach top has provided a suitable base for the development of dunes by the accretion of sand blown infrom flats exposed at low tide. In such situations, the Honkenya-Cakile vegetation can form a narrow, inter-rupted front to sequences of dune communities, the sandy patches around the plants giving way to a broken line of Elymus farctus foredunes, these in turn passing to Ammophila yellow dunes, with Leymus arenarius playing an important part in these younger stages at sites down the east coast. Honkenya, Cakile, Salsola and Atriplex spp. can persist for some time in these kinds of vegeta-tion as accretion progresses, but they are quickly over-whelmed as bigger mobile yellow dunes develop. Inmany of our dune systems, however, it is clear that both the Honkenya-Cakile stands and the Elymus foredunes are repeatedly renewed as bouts of fierce wind erosionand occasional tidal surges destroy the beach-top vege-tation and set back any advance of the sere. Distribution "
"sd3","Zonation and succession The Matricaria-Galium community often occurs as an isolated strip of vegetation running along the strandline, although it is sometimes contiguous downshore with marine algal swards and, with a shift to finer beachmaterial, can grade to upper salt-marsh vegetation. It is essentially a repeatedly-renewed pioneer assemblage and, even where it occurs on drift thrown high on to beaches, forming a front to dunes or various non-mar-itime communities, it cannot be seen as a serai precursor to them. Along very sheltered shores, the lower edge of Matri-caria-Galium stands can be regularly lapped by high tides and there the community may give way directly below to a zone of fucoids, usually Fucus vesiculosus or F. spiralis, with Mertensia in some of its localities, as on the Treshnish Isles off Mull, extending a little way into the littoral (Jermy & Crabbe 1978). In other places along the north-west coast of Scotland and on Shetland, the rare Atriplex praecox is abundant in a zone interposed between the strandline and the marine algae (Tasche-reau 1985). Elsewhere, with a shift to finer substrates or over the silt-or sand-smeared shingle that often forms a base for salt-marsh development around the hands of Scottish sea-lochs, the Matricaria-Galium community can peter out among upper salt-marsh vegetation. The most similar assemblage among these is the Elymetum https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.037 Published online by Cambridge University Press142 Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities repentis, a community of moist, drift-strewn soils around high tide mark, in which A triplex spp., R. crispus and Matricaria continue to find a place but where the grasses occasionally seen in the Matricria-Galium vege-tation, such as Elymus repens, Festuca rubra and Agrostis stolonifera, form the more extensive basis of a rank, weedy sward. A further, very distinctive zonation can be seen around some Scottish sea-lochs where the Matricaria-Galium community has developed on drift abutting freshwater seepage zones along the beach top. Here, it can form a low weedy front to the Filipendulo-Iridetum, plants like the Atriplex spp., Matricaria and Galium aparine running in as a sparse understorey, together with Agrostis stolonifera and Poa trivialis, to Irispseudacorus,Filipendula ulmaria and Oenanthe crocata in the Urtica-Galium or Atriplex sub-communities of the tall-herb fen.

Very often, the Elymus farctus community occurs in close association with the Honkenya-Cakile vegetation and, quite commonly, the two form an ill-defined linear mosaic of vegetation strung out along and just above strandlines subject to varying periods of erosion and accretion. The two assemblages intergrade continuously, being distinguished according to whether dominancelies with Honkenya and the strandline annuals on the one hand or with E. farctus on the other, this reflecting the balance between continuing disturbance by sea and wind along and just above the tidal limit and progressive accumulation of sand. In other places, where accretion has been able to continue unchecked, a better-defined and wider zone of Elymus farctus vegetation can be seen above the strandline, distributed over gently undulating stretches of sand or on distinct dunes, these sometimes very few and irregularly distributed, in other placesnumerous, rising in height towards the beach top and developed in lines parallel to the shore. Particularlyalong the coasts of north-east England and in Scotland, this simple pattern can be complicated by transitions between Elymus vegetation and foreshore Leymus stands. Along some coasts, such may be the limit of dune veg-etation, the sequence of communities being abruptly ter-minated inland by a switch to agricultural enclosures or golf-course rough and greens on reclaimed andimproved soils or to settlements and industrial develop-ments. More extensive sequences occur quite widely, however, and here the Elymus community typically occurs on foredunes which front larger yellow dunes with sometimes, behind these, immobile dunes and stretches of undulating sandy ground. Usually, in such situations, the Elymus vegetation passes to Ammophila dune stands, E. farctus and, to a lesser extent, plants such as Honkenya, Cakile and A triplex spp. retaining somerepresentation in the transitional zone. Patterns of thiskind can be seen all around the coasts of England and Wales, with Leymus vegetation and intermediate stands also figuring in the zonations along the coasts of North-umberland and at some sites in Lincolnshire. In its turn, the Ammophila community may give way to Ammophila-Festuca vegetation with Festuca-Galium assemblages becoming important in northern Britain. The studies of Harris & Davy (1968a, b) along the north Norfolk coast have demonstrated very clearly that strandline stands of Elymus farctus are maintained in more disturbed situations only by continual replenish-ment from such vegetation on foredunes behind and suggested that the classic serai progression might not occur very readily. Obviously, this has happened in past times, when it islikely that Elymus foredunes have been succeeded by Ammophila dunes and these in their turn by more stable tracts of vegetated sand. Along the outer fringes of our dune systems at the present time, however, the Elymus community may persist widely as a pioneer vegetation that is continually set back by more disturbed periods of wind and wave erosion. Distribution "
"sd5","Zonation and succession In many dune systems, particularly in southern and western Britain, Leymus has at most a minor role among younger dunes carrying the Elymus farctus and Ammo-phila communities but, along those coasts where Leymus vegetation is better developed, it usually dominates in amore or less well-defined zone between these two other assemblages, or tends to replace the Ammophila commu-nity as the most important builder of mobile dunes. In some areas, the Leymus community has increased its extent considerably within living memory but, even where it forms part of more extensive sequences, backed by other vegetation types on shifting or fixed dunes, such zonations do not necessarily represent straightforward successional developments. Through much of its range, Leymus vegetation occurs in close association with the Elymus farctus foreshore community, sometimes replacing it in a clear zonation with a shift a little way up the beach away from the strand-line with its more severe bouts of wind erosion and tidal disturbance, in other cases occurring intermixed with it in a complex linear mosaic over small foredunes runningalong the shore. Floristically, the two assemblages inter-grade continuously through the Elymus sub-community https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.039 Published online by Cambridge University Press150 Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities of the Leymus vegetation, but changes in dominance from the one grass to the other effectively distinguish them, the E. farctus community also generally retaining a more consistent scattering of strandline survivors like Honkenya, Cakile and Atriplex spp. Where Ammophila also invades mobile sand in which Leymus, and sometimes E. farctus too, have got a hold above the limit of even the extreme tides, the zonations are more complex. In such situations, the Leymus com-munity may give way behind to a distinct zone of Ammo-phila vegetation on bigger shifting dunes, but there can be transitional stretches where Leymus remains as animportant subsidiary element among the marram. This Leymus sub-community of the Ammophila vegetation has been recorded in these sequences at scattered local-ities up the east coast of Britain and occasionally on western shores. In other places, particularly over fore-dunes along the Lincolnshire and Humberside coasts and more locally in Northumberland, E. farctus also plays a prominent role right through a compressed zona-tion, with the Leymus-Elymus sub-community of Ammophila vegetation occurring behind the Elymus type of Leymus dune. In shifting further north up the eastern coast of Britain, the Leymus community tends to become more important among the vegetation of the younger mobile dunes, giving way behind to the somewhat more stable kinds of Ammophila assemblage, of the Festuca and Poa sub-communities, on sand that is a little more fixed. Leymus can persist as an occasional there and the Festuca sub-community of Leymus vegetation, with its scattered plants of Elymus repens, Sonchus arvensis and Hypochoeris radicata sometimes forms a transitional zone. But, eventually, such lyme grass as has not been overwhelmed by sand accretion loses its vigour and diesout, the plant hardly ever extending into the Ammophila-Poa or Festuca-Galium communities that cover much of the fixed sand of dunes and stretches of machair around our northern coasts.

"sd6","Zonation and succession Where there is little opportunity for accretion of wind-blown sand above the tidal limit, fragmentary stands of https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.040 Published online by Cambridge University Press158 Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities the Ammophila community may be the only kind of veg-etation maintaining itself on a narrow and ill-defined zone of low dunes exposed to the constant threat of erosion. In more extensive systems, though, this commu-nity can occupy wide tracts of mobile sand accumulat-ing behind strandline and foredunes, and giving way inland to stretches of more stable material deposited in fixed dunes or on sand plains. The zonations of vegeta-tion types across such landscapes have a generalisedform in which the Ammophila community represents an immature phase between the pioneer foreshore assem-blages and the more permanent products of succession on ground where accretion and erosion have come to a halt. However, the dynamics of dune development, and the accompanying vegetation changes, are often complex and the communities represented inthe sequences also vary considerably according to thephytogeographic influence of regional climate on the dune flora. Later stages in the successions are increas-ingly affected, too, by biotic factors like grazing and land treatment, which is often intensive and destructive of natural patterns. Throughout, there may be additional variation in the vegetation types related to the hydrology of the dune system, slacks or pools interrupting thebasic zonation. The Ammophila sub-community itself sometimes comprises the pioneer zone of vegetation on sand depos-ited above the tidal limit, helping to build up foredunes set back a little way from some kind of assemblage on the strandline and usually clearly marked off from itfloristically. Along many shores around Britain, however, the Elymus farctus community precedesAmmophila vegetation, establishing itself within the zone of periodic tidal inundation, colonising the strand-line itself and then stimulating modest accretion of wind-blown sand. Where this raises the beach level suffi-ciently, it can be instrumental in allowing Ammophila to invade, such that the low foredunes are occupied by the transitional Elymus sub-community, with its strandline survivors. Particularly down the eastern coast as far as Norfolk, Leymus arenarius complicates this basic zona-tion, being able to colonise a little further down the beach than Ammophila, sometimes invading an Elymus zone or coming to dominate in virtually pure stands on young dunes, when the Elymus-Leymus or Leymus sub-communities form a transition to the Ammophila sub-community on the bigger dunes behind. The Lincolnshire and Humberside coasts have some complex zonations in which all three of these grasses play a part. Except locally in Northumberland and parts of north-east Scotland, Orkney and Shetland, it is the Ammophila community rather than the Leymus vegetation which is the more important on younger mobile dunes and, eventhere, the latter begins to be excluded with accretionabove a certain speed and height. Around the whole coast, the species-poor Ammophila sub-community is the usual vegetation type where sand mobility is at its peak closer to the coastline or in the recolonisation ofmore catastrophic blow-outs in the dune hinterland,with the Carex sub-community figuring very locally on freshly-stabilised sand or where bared ground is a little moister. Further back in the dunes, where accretion has begun to slow down, the Ammophila sub-communitytypically gives way to the slightly richer and more varied Festuca sub-community or, increasingly towards themoister and cooler north of Britain, the Poa sub-com-munity. On dune systems where there is a more extended gra-dation from mobile to fixed sand, one or other of these latter kinds of Ammophila vegetation generally forms a transition to the Ammophila-Festuca community on dunes where accretion is appreciably slower and erosion increasingly rare (Figure 12). Here in addition to con-stant P. pratensis and F. rubra, which can increase their cover appreciably among the Ammophila, species such as Senecio jacobaea, Hypochoeris radicata, Taraxacum officinale agg., Galium verum and Lotus corniculatus, at most only moderately frequent in the Ammophila com-munity, become very common. In addition, Carex aren-aria and Hieracium pilosella are often found, while there are many occasional associates, including numerous plants hardly ever found on mobile dunes, such as Plan-tago lanceolata, Leontodon taraxacoides, Luzula cam-pestris and Cerastium fontanum. A number of bryophytes, too, increase their frequency and cover, with Brachythecium albicans, Tortula ruralis ssp. ruraliformis and Hypnum cupressiforme s.l becoming especially important, while on more open patches of the essentially stable surface, a variety of diminutive annuals come and go. Around our more southerly shores, Ononis repens is a further distinctive newcomer with the shift from what is usually the Festuca sub-community of the Ammophila vegetation to the Ononis or Viola sub-communities of Ammophila-Festuca vegetation. North of the Solway-Forth line, it is the Poa type of Ammophila dune which generally passes behind to the Typical or Hypnum sub-communities of the Ammophila-Festuca dune. In its turn, the Ammophila-Festuca dune can grade on fixed sand where the surface pH is often a little below neutral, though less drought-prone, to the Festuca-Galium community, a vegetation type widely distributed on older dunes all around the British coast, though espe-cially extensive on the sand-plains of the machair along the north-west Scottish seaboard. Bouts of erosion in both the Ammophila-Festuca community and, less com-monly, in the Festuca-Galium vegetation can lead to a local regeneration of the Ammophila community with sharper floristic boundaries at the switch to the newly mobile sand and, where there are more substantial shifts https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.040 Published online by Cambridge University PressSD6 Ammophila arenaria mobile dune community 159 in dune dynamics, whole areas of partly stabilised dune may be overtaken by freshly deposited sand on which the more immature vegetation gains a hold again. In this way, stands of the Ammophila community can be found developing next to calcifugous grassland, heath or other vegetation types of the dune hinterland before the sandfinally comes to a halt. Other variations on the basic zonation reflect edaphic and treatment differences. Where the sands are some-what more fixed, and particularly where there is little grazing, the Ammophila community may give wayinland, not to the Ammophila-Festuca vegetation, but to the Ammophila-Arrhenatherum community, the Gera-nium sanguineum sub-community of warm, south-facing dune slopes being particularly distinctive with its mixtures of Arrhenatherum, G sanguineum, Ononis rep ens, Dactylis glomerata, Galium verum and Veronica chamaedrys, together with occasional low bushes of Rosapimpinellifolia, among the Ammophila, P. pratensis and F rubra. Especially good examples of this kind of pattern can be seen on the Northumbrian dune systems. More species-poor rank mesophytic swards of the Ammophila-Arrhenatherum type can also sometimes form an intermediate zone between the Ammophila com-munity and dune-slack surrounds but these wetter areas Figure 12.

Distribution "
"sd7","Zonation and succession In ageing dune systems, the Ammophila-Festuca com-munity can occupy the first zone inland of the strandline on sand which has become more or less fixed but, where growth is still active, this vegetation is characteristically set back behind banks of foredunes and mobile dunes supporting different communities, only finding a place further towards the shore where there is a measure of local shelter. Inland, it can give way over ridges and sand-plains to dune grasslands and heath typical of https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.041 Published online by Cambridge University PressSD7 Ammophila arenaria-Festuca rubra semi-fixed dune community 167 largely stabilised surfaces, the sequence of vegetation types sometimes clearly representing a succession. However, the patterns are often interrupted by zonations to slack communities, where the height of the water-table mediates the vegetation gradient, and are much influenced landwards by treatments and land improve-ment or reclamation. In the most abbreviated beach-top sequences, where accretion and erosion are much reduced, there can be a sharp transition from the shore, sometimes with a strip of strandline vegetation, to more open stands of the Ammophila-Festuca community. Generally, though, even where the sand supply has become much reduced, the exposed face of the most seaward dunes carries the Ammophila community, the Ammophila-Festuca vegeta-tion being limited to the lee slopes where the material is much less mobile. In southern Britain, it is the Ononis sub-community which is characteristic of these youngersheltered faces, with a zone of the Festuca sub-commu-nity of the Ammophila vegetation sometimes interposed in the transition to very open marram on the exposed, shifting sand. Around northern coasts, Typical Ammophila-Festuca vegetation replaces the Ononis sub-community, with the Poa type of Ammophila vegetation occurring where there is a more gradual shift to the imma-ture marram. Then, especially down the east coast, and where the dunes remain low, these early sequences can be complicated by the persistence of Leymus arenarius, the Festuca sub-community of Leymus vegetation sometimes occurring on more mobile or disturbed surfaces among tracts of Typical Ammophila-Festuca grassland. Where the zonations continue on to sand which is becoming more fixed, the Ononis and Typical sub-com-munities usually give way to the Hypnum type, the differ-ent vegetation types sometimes being found as distinctzones but more usually disposed in complex mosaics over surfaces of individual dunes or ridges where there is a diversity of aspects variously sheltered from the windand sun. Locally severe erosion may result in a rejuvena-tion of the Ammophila community or the spread of Car ex arenaria vegetation in blow-outs within such pat-terns. More local appearance of bare but still quite stable sand is often marked by patches of the Tortulo-Phle-etum, particular on dune systems in the warmer and drier south of Britain. In bigger dune systems, where there are expanses of fixed sand which have not been reclaimed, the more mature kinds of Ammophila-Festuca vegetation are fre-quently transitional inland to closed dune grassland, usually of the Festuca-Galium type. Here, Ammophila often remains very common, but it is generally much reduced in vigour, with Festuca rubra and Poapratensis now typically providing the bulk of the grass cover. By this stage, the sands have become somewhat richer in organic matter and nutrients, and are more water-reten-tive, so the swards fill up and take on a more mesophytic character. Plants that are generally only occasional in the Ammophila-Festuca community become very fre-quent with Galium verum, Plantago lanceolata, Trifo-lium repens, Lotus corniculatus and Achillea millefolium especially distinctive, Ranunculus acris, Bellis perennis and Euphrasia officinalis agg. sometimes important,and a variety of other grasses, sedges and dicotyledons appearing that hardly ever figure on the more mobile, droughty and impoverished sands. Mosses such as Tortula ruralis ssp. ruraliformis and Homalothecium lutescens remain common but some pleurocarpous species like Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, R. triquetrus, Calliergon cuspidatum and Pseudoscleropodium purum also occur among the turf. Grazing also has a more obvious effect upon the appearance of the vegetation than is the case with the communities of more mobiledunes sometimes trimming down the herbage to a short sward, but open patches are scarce and, where scuffing or droughting of the surface creates a gap, the appear-ance of assemblages of annuals is usually best seen as a transition to recurring Ammophila-Festuca vegetation. As with the communities of more mobile sand, there are some regional differences among the various kinds of Festuca-Galium grasslands, some of the most striking and extensive zonations occurring over the sand-plains along the very wet north-west seaboard of Scotland. There, the Typical and Hypnum sub-communities of Ammophila-Festuca vegetation on the semi-mobile dunes give way on the stretches of machair to the Ranunculus-Bellis and Prunella sub-communities of the Festuca-Galium grassland. More locally, rather different zonations can be seen. Where there is little or no grazing on less mobile sands, a rather rare kind of situation on British dunes, the Ammophila-Festuca community can give way to the Ammophila-Arrhenatherum vegetation. This is a gener-ally rather rank sward which has a number of character-istic plants in common with other assemblages of surfaces that are becoming fixed, like Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Ononis repens, Galium verum, Lotus cornicula-tus and Achillea millefolium, but the transition differs from zonations to the Festuca-Galium grassland in the prominence of Arrhenatherum elatius and Dactylis glo-merata. These, and plants such as Heracleum sphondy-lium and Lathyrus pratensis often bring the vegetation close to an inland Arrhenatherion sward, but in someplaces the Ammophila-Festuca community passes on sunny, south-facing dune faces to a more striking kind of Ammophila-Arrhenatherum in which Geranium sanguin-eum is a constant feature, with scattered bushes of Rosa pimpinellifolia. A more common variation occurs where the sands have become more sharply surface-leached on the fixed dune surfaces, when the Ammophila-Festuca commu-https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.041 Published online by Cambridge University Press168 Shingle, strandline and sand-dune communities nity can give way to the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grass-land. Here, again, Ammophila is often reduced to a minor and not very vigorous component in the swards, but F rubra and P. pratensis are now usually matched in frequency and often in cover by F. ovina, A. capillaris and C. arenaria. Plants like Hypochoeris radicata, Lotus corniculatus and Galium verum remain fairly common but, with the increased importance of Galium saxatile, Luzula campestris, Rumex acetosella and acidophilous bryophytes, the vegetation approaches a dry calcifuge grassland in its appearance, especially where it is grazed, as is often the case. Transitions of this kind may also involve the local occurrence of patches of the Carex-Cladonia community on areas of open but compacted sand and, where ericoids gain a hold, there can be stands of Calluna-Carex heath. All these different kinds of zonations may be inter-rupted by the occurrence of slack vegetation where theground water table comes sufficiently close to the surface between the dunes to keep the sand permanently moist or at least seasonally flooded. On more calcareous sands, the Salix-Holcus community often occurs around the slack edges, with drier kinds of Potentilla-Carex vegeta-tion on substrates that are less base-rich but, in both cases, boundaries are usually much sharper where the Ammophila-Festuca community occurs over the sur-rounding dune slopes, than where the Festuca-Galium vegetation provides the context. F. rubra often maintains some representation in the slacks, with herbs like Lotuscorniculatus, Ranunculus acris, Trifolium repens and Euphrasia officinalis variously recorded, but Ammophila disappears sharply at the slack surrounds and plants such as Poa pratensis and Car ex arenaria sometimes pen-etrate little further. Distribution "
"sd8","Zonation and succession Where wind-blown sand has become stabilised over the surface of raised beaches, low shelves of rock or terraces of superficials set back but a little way from the shore, the Festuca-Galium community can occupy the first veg-etated zone behind the beach top or cliffs. In more exten-sive dune systems, however, it typically occurs on older ridges or plains inland from tracts of somewhat more mobile sand, on which it is generally replaced byAmmophila-Festuca vegetation. There, with continuing modest accretion, Ammophila is more consistently prominent, retaining some vigour and holding its own against the smaller rhizomatous grasses, with more spo-radic representation of the range of perennial herbs that only become really common as the surface is finally fixed. Often, though, the two communities intergrade, the boundaries between them depending on the varying proportions of marram and F rubra, and the differing frequencies of associates such as G verum, L. cornicula-tus, P lanceolata, C.fontanum, T. repens, H. radicata and Figure 13. Vegetation pattern in the machair landscape of the Outer Isles. The dune system is fronted by narrow zones of SD2 Honkenya-Cakile and SD4 Elymusfarctus vegetation and the SD7 Ammophila-Festuca community. Behind, the sand-plain has extensive areas of various kinds of SD8 Festuca-Galium grassland with scattered fields cultivated for oats and rye or potatoes or reverting as fallow to MG11 Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla grassland. Behind large MG7 Lolium leys, are fields with mosaics of MG10 Holco-Juncetum, MG13 Agrostis-Alopecurus grassland and M28 Filipendulo-Iridetum, interspersed with purer stands of the last.

Around our southern coasts, the usual tran-sition is from the Ononis sub-community of Ammophila-Festuca vegetation to the Typical or, more locally, the Luzula or Tortula sub-communities of the Festuca-Galium vegetation. Towards the north-west of Britain where, on the machair, stretches of stabilised sand are especially extensive, these generally carry the Bellis-Ranunculus or Prunella sub-communities, passing onyounger dunes to Typical Ammophila-Festuca vegeta-tion. Particularly in southern Britain, locally bare areas within the Festuca-Galium Community often have patches of the Tortulo-Phleetum. With more abrupt transitions to areas of highly mobile sand, as where severe erosion has been precipitated among stable dunes following surface disturbance of some kind, stretches of Festuca-Galium vegetation can be punctuated by stands of the Ammophila community, where rejuvenated marram may be accompanied by little else at first among the shifting substrate. Or, where sand eventually settles in and around such blow-outs, the Carex arenaria com-munity may develop, sharply marked off from the sur-rounding Festuca-Galium swards or grading to them as tillers of F. rubra and Ammophila spread in among the sedge. Over fixed dunes where there is some variation in base-richness of the sand surface, the Festuca-Galium com-munity is often accompanied by other swards, the zonations between the vegetation types being especially gradual where, as is frequently the case, grazing by stock or rabbits helps keep all the herbage short and diverse. Sometimes, it is the varied intensity of leaching of what seem to be fairly uniform sands that has produced differ-ences in surface pH, but very commonly such patterns are influenced by contrasts in the lime-content of the wind-blown sediments, something which is usually dependent on the proportion of shell fragments to sili-ceous material. With a shift on to more acid sands, where the pH can fall from near 8 down to 5 or less, the Festuca-Galium community is often replaced by the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grassland. There, marram remains similarly moribund but F rubra is generally accompa-nied and sometimes replaced by F ovina and, along with frequent and often abundant C arenaria, there is com-monly some Agrostis capillaris and Anthoxanthum, grasses which make only an occasional contribution tothe Festuca-Galium community. Herbs such as G verum, L. corniculatus, C. fontanum, T repens and Campanula rotundifolia can remain fairly frequent, but Galium saxa-tile now becomes very common and, among the mosses, Dicranum scoparium, Hylocomium splendens and Pleu-rozium schreberi accompany Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus and Pseudoscleropodium purum. Generally, then, the sward has the look of a Nardo-Galion community rather than some kind of mesotrophic grasslandalthough, again, transitions can be gradual, particularly where the Luzula sub-community of Festuca-Galium grassland passes to the Anthoxanthum sub-community of the Carex-Festuca-Agrostis vegetation, a zonation that is especially common in dune systems down theeastern Scottish and Northumberland coasts. In some places, such patterns are further complicated by the occurrence on compacted sand, or on sand-shingle mix-tures, of the Carex-Cornicularia community, where the turf is much more open and where lichens such as Cor-nicularia aculeata, Cladonia arbuscula, C. foliacea, C. impexa, C furcata and Cfimbriata are a very prominent feature. Transitions from the Festuca-Galium community to more obviously calcicolous swards are much more local, but they can be seen where shell-sand has been deposited over exposures of limestone or calcareous drift with rendziniform soils. Along parts of the south Wales coast, for example, Carboniferous Limestone underlies some stretches of fixed dune, and in a few places the Tortula sub-community of Festuca-Galium vegetation passes to Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland with the shift on to sandy rendzinas. Ammophila, C arenaria and F rubra largely disappear with this transition but among a grassy turf of F ovina and K. macrantha, plants like T praecox, H. pilosella and S. acre provide some continu-ity, together with H. lutescens and P. purum in what is often an extensive moss layer. Far to the north, where wind-blown sand has been deposited among exposures of Durness Limestone along the Sutherland coast, com-parable zonations can be seen very locally between the Be His-Ranunculus and Prunella types of Festuca-Galium grassland and the Dryas-Carex heath. Again, Festuca-Galium grassland and the Dryas-Carex heath. Again, Ammophila and C. arenaria drop out, while plants like Dryas octopetala, Carex flacca, C panicea, Plantago maritima and Antennaria dioica become very common, but L. corniculatus, B. perennis, G verum, K. macrantha, T. praecox, H. pilosella and Homalothecium lutescens continue to give character to many stands of the heath and some fine mosaics of the vegetation types have ill-defined boundaries. The other important kind of edaphic variation that influences vegetation patterns on the fixed sands where the Festuca-Galium community occurs is related to the height of the ground water table. In depressions among undulating sand-plains or between ridges of immobile dunes, this can come close to the surface, keeping the ground very moist or waterlogged through much of theyear, or even giving some flooding in winter. Then, the Festuca-Galium swards typically give way to some kind of slack vegetation, usually around the drier margins of more base-rich slacks, of the Salix-Holcus type. That community is quite varied, but some of the more mois-ture-tolerant plants of the Festuca-Galium vegetation https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.042 Published online by Cambridge University PressSD8 Festuca rubra-Galium verum fixed dune grassland 181 can run on into slacks with some frequency, F. rubra, H lanatus, C. arenaria, L. corniculatus, T. repens, Euphrasia officinalis agg. and Prunella commonly making a contri-bution to the sward. With the appearance of Salix repens, however, and such associates as Epipactis palus-tris, Car ex panicea and Hydro cotyle vulgar is, together with varied suites of other herbs and bryophytes, there is often little difficulty in discerning boundaries between the vegetation types, especially where sudden transitionsto wetter ground occur among dunes in drier parts of the country with Typical Festuca-Galium forming the usual slack surround. In the wetter north-west of Britain, and particularly over the gently rolling sand-plains of the machair, the zonations can be less well defined because more moisture-demanding herbs extend further into theFestuca-Galium community and the slack vegetation tends not to be so strictly confined to lower depressions. Here, then, stretches of the more mesophytic Bellis-Ranunculus and Prunella sub-communities often pass more gradually into Salix-Holcus vegetation, sometimes with an intervening zone of the Festuca-Agrostis-Poten-tilla grassland. Wetter slacks then see a transition to the Salix-Colliergon or Salix-Campy Hum community. Where transitions to wetter ground also involve a reduc-tion in the base-richness of the substrate, as with a shift on to moist acid sands, the Potentilla-Carex slack replaces the Salix-Holcus and these other communitiesin such sequences. There, it is the presence of mixtures of P. anserina, C. nigra, S. repens, Galium palustre, Ranun-culus flammula and Cardamine pratensis that distinguish the damp swards, giving the look of a poor fen. With the increased stability of the surface among fixed dunes, and the more hospitable nutrient and moisture regimes beneath the Festuca-Galium vegetation, there are enhanced possibilities of serai progression to scrub or woodland. Very commonly, though, such succession is held in check by the grazing of stock or rabbits, so that the community is maintained as a plagioclimax. Where there is some relief from the predations of herbivores, Festuca-Galium swards can grow more rank, grasses such as F. rubra, H lanatus and Dactylis taking on a more tussocky appearance, and herbs like Heracleum, Centaurea nigra and Daucus carota growing up tall from their basal rosettes, producing something like a Centau-reo-Cynosuretum. More locally, but especially along the north-east coast of England, the Ammophila-Arrhen-atherum community can occur among Festuca-Galium vegetation where there is little or no grazing. Here, F rubra and Ammophila can both persist in some quantity, with P. pratensis, H lanatus, A. millefolium, G. verum and L. corniculatus also often present, but Arrhenath-erum is a very common and sometimes abundantfeature, with frequent Dactylis, Veronica chamaedrys and Heracleum confirming the character of an Arrhena-therion sward. On warmer dune slopes, the additionalpresence of Geranium sanguineum and patches of Rosa pimpinellifolia can mark out such transitions even more strikingly. Continued freedom from grazing can allow the inva-sion of Rubusfruticosus agg. among the Festuca-Galiumgrassland producing patches of Rubus-Holcus under-scrub, with rank growth of F. rubra, P. pratensis, H lanatus, Dactylis, Arrhenatherum and umbellifers around the bramble, or bracken may spread in stands of Pteridium-Rubus vegetation. In other cases, the removal or demise of herbivores has allowed the direct invasion of trees, birch frequently figuring prominently in such successions, with conifers sometimes seeding in from nearby plantations. Where reduction of grazing has taken place on patchworks of Festuca-Galium grassland and Carex-Festuca-Agrostis swards on more acid sands, rank derivatives of the former often persist among some kind of Calluna-Carex heath, where mixtures of Calluna vulgaris with Erica cinerea or Empetrum nigrum ssp. nigrum are characteristically dominant among calcifuge herbs, bryophytes and lichens. Landward patterns among stretches of Festuca-Galium vegetation are often further confused by various kinds of dune reclamation or improvement. Sometimes,but a small zone of natural fixed dune persists as a fringeto a golf course, on which the Festuca-Galium swards may survive only in a modified form in periodically mown rough, or to pasture where the community has been entirely replaced by sown Lolio-Cynosuretum or Lolio-Plantaginion leys. More strikingly, on the machair, Festuca-Galium grassland can be seen among extensive patchworks of rotational arable land, havingescaped cultivation or being in various stages of rever-sion after short periods under the plough. Finally, on many dune systems, stands of the community give way abruptly to conifer plantations established on the stable sand. Distribution "
"sd9","Zonation and succession The Ammophila-Arrhenatherum grassland is usually found as a local replacement for other swards on more stabilised calcareous dunes, occurring in zonations and mosaics which are presumably influenced, at least in part, by variations in grazing intensity. In many places, the community could probably progress very readily to scrub with the invasion of shrubs and trees, or to bracken, and stands are sometimes found among thesekinds of vegetation. In the generalised sequence of communities on British dunes, the Ammophila-Arrhenatherum grassland gener-ally occurs where more mature Ammophila-Festuca swards or Festuca-Galium vegetation would otherwise be found and, on more varied systems, it often grades tothese. Compared with the former community, the most obvious differences can be the abundance of Arrhenath-erum and, particularly with the shift to younger duneridges, Typical Ammophila-Arrhenatherum grassland may pass quite gradually to the Ononis sub-community of Ammophila-Festuca vegetation with changes in domi-nance of the grasses. Commonly, however, neighbouring Ammophila-Festuca swards on more fixed sands have a greater variety and abundance of smaller herbs andbryophytes, with species such as Hypochoeris radicata, Taraxacum officinale agg.; Leontodon taraxacoides, Hieracium pilosella, Brachythecium albicans, Tortula ruralis ssp. ruraliformis and Hypnum cupressiforme becoming important. With the move to more heavilygrazed stretches of stabilised dunes, some of these same plants make a frequent appearance where theAmmophila-Arrhenatherum grassland gives way to Festuca-Galium vegetation. In transitions to the Luzula sub-community of that kind of grassland, for example, a common vegetation type on Northumbrian dunes, the decline in Arrhenatherum is accompanied by a rise in their frequency along with small tussock grasses likeKoeleria, Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum and Festuca ovina among the grazed down F. rubra, P. pratensis, C. arenaria and L. campestris. Where more acidic sands occur, this zonation can continue into stands of Carex-Festuca-Agrostis grassland. Alternatively, the Ammophila-Arrhenatherum com-munity can pass to Typical Festuca-Galium vegetation where the occasional occurrence of Arrhenatherum, Dactylis, Heracleum and Cirsium arvense, with frequent Achillea and S. Jacobaea in sometimes rough F. rubra-dominated swards, can give a greater measure of conti-nuity to the zonation. Mixtures of these two communities can also be found among patches of scrubby vegetation on less heavily grazed dunes. There, the Ammophila-Arrhenatherum grassland can give way to clumps of Rubus-Holcus underscrub, the grassy margins of which, with rank H. lanatus, Arrhenatherum and Dactylis, umbellifers and tall weedy herbs, have much in common with the surrounding dune swards (Figure 14). Or, where bracken invades along with the bramble, there may be transitions to Pteridium-Rubus underscrub. In other cases, particularly on some of the Humber dune systems, Hippophae rhamnoides scrub can be found among Ammophila-Arrhenatherum grassland, Festuca rubra and Ammophila tending to persist most prominently in the Typical sub-community, Arrhenath-erum remaining common, often among nitrophilous weeds, in the Urtica-Galium sub-community. Or there can be zonations to Ligustrum vw/gare-dominated stands of the Crataegus-Hedera scrub or grassy Prunus-Rubus scrub. Distribution "

"sm10","Zonation and succession In the low marsh, the community will be replaced by others as accretion progresses: in the south-east most probably by the Puccinellietum maritimae or the Halimionetumportulacoidis, in the west by the former or, more rarely, by the Juncetum gerardi. Creekside occur-rences are part of what is probably a static zonation rather than a successional sequence. Distribution "
"sm11","Zonation and succession In the low marsh the association forms a distinct zone above the Salicornietum europaeae or the Spartinetum townsendii or, occasionally, at the most seaward limit. Upwards it passes into the Puccinellietum maritimae or the Halimionetum portulacoidis. Landward boundaries are diffuse and patches of the association are frequently found in the lower part of the zone above. Although A. tripolium var. discoideus can grow at lower levels on the shore than many salt-marsh species, it is not a successful primary coloniser. Gray (1971) has suggested that it has spread in recent years, possibly fol-lowing Spartina anglica invasion of bare substrates, but the evidence for this is inconclusive. At Scolt Head, Norfolk, Chapman (1959) has shown the association developing from the Salicornietum europaeae in about 25 years. Distribution "
"sm12",""
"sm13","Zonation and succession Where the Puccinellietum is a pioneer community, as on sandier substrates, it appears to establish itself mainly by the rooting of vegetative fragments of P. maritima uprooted from existing swards by grazing stock and carried by tides (Ranwell 1961, Brereton 1971, Adam 1976, Gray & Scott 1977a). P. maritima can set abundant seed (Gray & Scott 1911 a) but it has no special dispersal mechanism and, though caryopses can be washed away, seedling establishment in the pioneer zone seems uncommon. Once established, the scattered plants produce numer-ous radiating stolons and accrete sediment into a series of hummocks (see Plate 3 in Ranwell 1972). Hummock size varies from shore to shore: some hummocks never exceed 50 cm in height but others are taller and attain a diameter of several metres. The hummock tops may carry the transitional Puccinellia-Salicornia-Suaeda community. Yapp & Johns (1917) postulated that the intervening hollows developed into pans but Pethwick (1974) showed that such a model could not account for the majority of upper-marsh pans. At some sites a narrow zone of very scattered hum-mocks gives way quickly to a continuous sward of the Puccinellia-dominditQd sub-community. In other cases the hummocky topography persists much higher upshore (see the striking photographs in Yapp & Johns 1917) and eventually passes to fairly smooth swards of some Puccinellietum vegetation or, in the mid-and upper marsh, to Juncetum gerardi which is the usual high level vegetation of the grazed marshes of the westcoast (Figure 8). On ungrazed west coast sites, theLimonium-Armeria sub-community may occur in the upper marsh. In the south-east, the Puccinellietum is rarely a pioneer community. Its position in the zonation varies, the Puccinellia-dominaXQd sub-community appearing either below or above the Halimionetum portulacoidis. In this region, the Puccinellietum can be found right up to the tidal limit, either as the Puccinellia-dominatGd sub-community, as around The Wash, or as the verycharacteristic high marsh Limonium-Armeria sub-com-munity. In the upper reaches of estuaries, where the soil salinity in the lower marsh is kept constantly low by freshwater dilution, an inversion of the normal zona-tion may be found with the Puccinellietum in upper marsh depressions where evaporation produces high salinities (Gillham 1957a, Adam 1976). Disturbance of upper marsh sites frequently results in the association appearing as a secondary pioneer, especially in the form of the Puccinellia-Glaux sub-community (cf. Beeftink 1962). In the loch-head sites where the Puccinellia-turf fucoid sub-community is characteristic, it is frequentlythe lowest vegetation but it seems only rarely to be actively expanding. To seaward, there is usually a very low cliff or the vegetation cover is discontinuous withdiscrete patches on isolated rock or gravel plinths. Distribution "
"sm14","Zonation and succession Where Halimionetum occurs within the marsh zonation, its position is variable. It can be either above or below the Puccinellietum maritimae and boundaries between the two associations can be marked by mosaics (see Coril-lion 1953). At some sites, Halimionetum may run right from the upper limit of the pioneer zone to the sea wall. Where it does extend far down the marsh there is some-times an open mosaic of H portulacoides and Arthrocne-mumperenne at its lower limit. The association can occur on creek levees whether or not there is a nearby inter-creek zone of Halimionetum. Where it occurs in both situations on the same marsh, the creek Halimionetum may be above or below the inter-creek zone. Usually the creek Halimionetum cuts across the boundaries of a number of marsh communities. On the high marsh, Halimionetum in both situationsmay give way to a zone of Atriplici-Elymetumpycnanthi, sometimes with an intervening but patchy zone of Artemisietum maritimae. This zonation may indicate a successional sequence consequent upon sediment accre-tion. The origin and successional status of the Puccinellia maritima sub-community is obscure. Its distinctivephysiognomy may arise by invasion of the H. portula-coides-dominaiQd sub-community by P. maritima when the canopy opens with ageing of the bushes or as a result of grazing or by invasion of Puccinellietum by H portu-lacoides. Alternatively the co-dominants may simultane-ously invade some other salt-marsh community. Only long-term observation can elucidate the process(es)involved here. Other changes can occur within Halimionetum as a result of frost or human disturbance (Beeftink 1911 a, b; Beeftink et al. 1978). Killing of H portulacoides on creek levees by frost can result in the temporary replacement of the association by Artemisietum maritimae for 4-5 years. Disturbance in inter-creek basins produces a phase characterised by Suaeda maritima and Aster tripo-lium. Distribution "
"sm15","Zonation and succession There is a marked difference in the relative position ofthe association on salt-marshes in south-east England and those elsewhere but lack of submersion data makes it difficult to assess these variations in terms of absolute relationships to tidal levels. On the west and Channel coasts, the association generally occurs at relatively low levels in association with the Spartinetum townsendii or more usually within or at the upper limit of the Pucci-ne Hie turn maritimae. In the south-east, a narrow belt of the association occurs normally between the Puccinel-lietum maritimae, Limonium-Armeria sub-community,and the Atriplici-Elymetumpycnanthi or the tall Festuca rubra sub-community of the Juncetum gerardi. Theassociation grades smoothly into the Puccinellietum which effectively constitutes the understorey of the Juncus-Triglochin vegetation. On those few ungrazed western marshes where the Puccinellietum maritimae, https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.019 Published online by Cambridge University PressSM15 Juncusmaritimus-Triglochin maritima salt-marsh 69 Limonium-Armeria sub-community occurs, the associa-tion occupies the position typical of south-east salt-marshes. In at least one site, Juncus maritimus has been seen as a coloniser with Spartina anglica. Distribution "
"sm16","Zonation and succession In general, the Juncetum gerardi occupies a position above the Puccinellietum maritimae in the salt-marsh zonation but the extent of the Juncetum in the south-east differs strikingly from its contribution to salt-marsheselsewhere. In the south-east, the association is of very limited extent and occurs only at high levels in the marsh, most often forming a discontinuous zone in contact with the Limonium-Armeria sub-community of the Puccinellietum. In the north and west, the Juncetum is usually very extensive in both the mid-and upper-marsh. The exact reasons for this difference, and for the more seaward extension of particular species in the west, are unknown (Beeftink 1977a, b, Adam 1978) but the major factor controlling the relative positions of the two associations is the degee of submersion. In upper estuar-ies, where there is freshwater dilution, the positions of the Juncetum and Puccinellietum are reversed. The loca-tion and nature of the junction between the associationsis also affected markedly by the extent and nature of the grazing. Within the Juncetum, there is usually a zonation of the different sub-communities in relation to their tolerance of submersion. The detailed pattern varies from site to site and, though the Festuca-Glaux sub-community usually gives way to the Leontodon sub-community up-marsh, the relative depth of the zones is very variable (Figure 9). In some cases, there is a complex mosaic of the two communities over the mid-marsh. The Leonto-don sub-community may, in turn, pass into the Carex flacca sub-community. Provided that the upper limit of the salt-marsh is not an artificial boundary, the topmost zone grades into non-maritime grassland or mire (e.g. Gillham 1957Z?). The tall Festuca rubra sub-community often forms part of zonations with the Halimionetum, sometimes occupying a position between this associa-tion and fragmentary stands of the Artemisietum. The zonation of the sub-communities may represent a successional sequence in response to substrate accretion and the gradual raising of salt-marsh surfaces. Grazing too, can, be responsible for considerable temporal changes within the Juncetum gerardi (see above) and may shift the succession towards the development of otherassociations. Very heavy grazing, particularly by cattleand horses on clay and silt substrates, can lead to poach-ing and the appearance of Puccinellietum maritimae or to communities characteristic of disturbed saline sites such as the Puccinellietum distantis and the Agrostis stolonifera-Alopecurus geniculatus community. Turf-cutting opens up areas for colonisation by a variety of species. In the early stages a variety of annuals and short-lived perennials predominate: Spergularia marina, Juncus bufonius, Plantago coronopus and Sagina maritima, for example, often with Pottia heimii. Diverse assemblages of such species have sometimes been clas-sified within the Saginetea. Puccinellia maritima is fre-quently an early colonist and a closed Puccinellietum maritimae may develop. P maritima may persist within a Festuca rubra sward to produce a patchwork of the tran-sitional vegetation of the Puccinellia sub-community of the Juncetum gerardi. It is this pattern of recolonisation which helps make grazing and turf-cutting compatible activities on the same salt-marsh. Distribution "
"sm17","Zonation and succession The association is normally found as a patchy zone between the Halimionetum and Atriplici-Elymetum pyc-nanthi. Junctions with the former may be marked by an intermediate zone with abundant Festuca rubra. This zonation may reflect a succession related to increase in marsh height with sediment accretion. Distribution "
"sm18","Zonation and succession At a few sites, there is a zonation within single extensive stands of the association from the Plantago sub-commu-nity through the Oenanthe sub-community to the Festuca sub-community. More generally, isolated stands of each of the sub-communities occur within other com-munities, the Oenanthe and Plantago sub-communities usually within the Juncetum gerardi, though the Plan-tago sub-community may also extend down-marsh into the upper part of the Puccinellietum maritimae. Unlike these two sub-communities where stands are sharply defined the Festuca sub-community often has rather diffuse boundaries with its neighbouring communities on the upper marsh. Juncus maritimus can be an aggressive invader. Packham & Liddle (1970) reported the transformation of an area of Puccinellietum maritimae within the space of 20 years. It has been conventional in British accounts to regard Juncus maritimus salt-marsh, if not as the true climax of succession, then at least as a very stable stage in upper marsh development which can be consideredfor most purposes as the climax. The association isclearly important on those marshes where it occurs but it is probably better to see it as part of a serai sequence par-allel to that involving the Juncetum gerardi. Distribution "
"sm19","Zonation and succession Although B. rufus sometimes occurs as scattered shoots within the Juncetum gerardi (notably at Caerlaverock NNR, Dumfries & Galloway; Martin 1977), stands of the Blysmetum are usually rather sharply defined from the Juncetum gerardi which is the usual surrounding veg-etation. Freshwater flushing over gravel sometimes allows the association to develop at fairly low levels in the marsh but it is unlikely that the Blysmetum plays any role in succession. Distribution "

"sm23","Zonation and succession Mosaics of the various sub-communities appear to develop in relation to differences in soil salinity levels and the height of the water-table. In coastal sites, the association is usually rather sharply marked off from thesurrounding vegetation, often Juncetum gerardi or Puc-cinellietum maritimae, though in some cases there may be a more gradual transition to a Puccinellietum mariti-mae with large amounts of Puccinellia distans (e.g. the upper reaches of the tidal Nene; Adam & Akeroyd 1978). The association is maintained by continued distur-bance. If this ceases, then a closed sward of the sur-rounding vegetation is likely to extend into the Puccinellietum distantis. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.027 Published online by Cambridge University Press100 Salt-marsh communities Distribution "
"sm24","Zonation and succession The association often terminates the zonation at the upper limit of British salt-marshes. A common pattern, seen on many Essex salt-marshes and around the Exe in Devon (Proctor 1980), runs from Spartinetum townsendii or Asteretum tripolii through Halimione turn portulacoidis to the Atriplici-Elymetum. The largest stands of the asso-ciation appear to have developed from the Halimione turn. On creek levees, the association may develop from the Artemisietum maritimae or, more locally, the Spartine-tum townsendii. On high-level drift, there is sometimes a succession from the Atriplex strand-lines to the associa-tion. In sites inundated by only very exceptional storms, the association may be invaded by shrubs and trees but succession to woodland is likely to be prevented by the occasional subjection to saline waters. Distribution "
"sm25","Zonation and succession The association marks a particular type of transition from the upper marsh to other maritime communities and the driftline stands are probably stable in time. The low-level stands of the Halimione sub-community overlap the habitat of the Frankenia laevis sub-commu-nity of the Suaeda vera-Limonium binervosum salt-marsh and at some sites in north Norfolk there is a mosaic of the two communities. The balance between them could be controlled by rabbit-grazing. Chapman (19606) suggested that Limonium bellidifolium declined on Hut Marsh, Scolt Head Island, Norfolk because of the increased vigour of H portulacoides following the reduction there of rabbit-grazing.

"sm6","Zonation and succession S. x townsendii was first noticed around Southampton Water in the 1870s and is presumed to be a natural hybrid between the native Spartina maritima and theintroduced S. alterniflora (Marchant 1967). Its slow natural spread was quickly overtaken by the much more vigorous fertile amphidiploid S. anglica which, in the 20 years after its first appearance in Southampton Water and The Solent probably around 1890, had colonisedevery estuary and salt-marsh between Chichester andPoole (see, for example, Goodman et al. 1959, 1969,Hubbard 1965, Ranwell 1967, Hubbard & Stebbings 1967). Widespread planting for reclamation after 1910 extended the distribution of S. anglica in Britain and natural spread from these centres has filled many gaps. S. x townsendii appears to have been transmitted to a number of scattered localities by inclusion of sterile material in transplant consignments but this species probably accounted for less than 20 ha out of a total of over 12000 ha of marsh dominated by S. townsendii s. I in Great Britain at the last detailed survey (Hubbard & Stebbings 1967). Once established, the plants perennate and reproduce naturally by rhizome fragmentation, especially wherethe tidal run is fast, as at Bridgwater Bay (Ranwell 1964a) and, in the case of S. anglica, by seed, the set of which is regular though variable in quantity (Goodman et al. 1969). Spread from such fragments or seedlings can be rapid in S. anglica with clonal patches expanding and coalescing into clumps and then closing to a sward; in other cases discrete patches may persist for long periods.In many places S. anglica has become established on previously bare substrates and initiated the development of new marshes. Accretion of material has been found to vary between 0.5 and 10 cm/year (Ranwell 1964a, Bird & Ranwell 1964); at the higher rates something like 500 cm/ha/year of material is deposited. Accretion rate may depend on local climate, the tidal pattern and perhapsthe seasonal microflora (Ranwell 1964a) and the subse-quent marsh drainage pattern may be influenced by the slope, tidal range and substrate type (Braybrooks & J. M. Lambert, unpublished). Accretion eventually raises the marsh surface to a level at which other speciescan theoretically compete with the S. anglica but, although species from Puccinellietum maritimae and Juncetum gerardi communities occur occasionallywithin swards, they are never particularly abundant andcompetition with the tall and vigorous S. anglica may prevent overtopping and the replacement of the commu-nity. Litter accumulation or frost action (Hubbard & Stebbings 1967, Ranwell 1972) and grazing (Ranwell 1961, Goodman et al. 1969) may initiate the opening up of the S. anglica sward and allow the spread of Puccinel-lia maritima. On the higher parts of ungrazed marshes there is evi-dence of invasion by a variety of plants. At Bridgwater Bay, a short-period sub-seral alternation of S. anglica and A triplex hastata has been observed on accumulated drift with sand (Ranwell 1961, 19646). A. hastata hasalso invaded the upper part of a S. anglica marsh at Lytham on the Ribble estuary. At Keysworth in PooleHarbour, Elymus pycnanthus has invaded (Hubbard & Stebbings 1968). There and at Bridgwater, Scirpus marit-imus and Phragmites australis have also appeared at higher levels and replaced about 50% of the S. anglica sward in 12 years. Ranwell (1972) has suggested that such a process is favoured by the development of less saline conditions consequent upon land-drainage seepage but this has not been widely investigated. Halim-ione portulacoides can establish itself along creek margins within S. anglica marshes (Goodman et al. 1959). S. anglica has also become established on existing marshes. Invasion of Zostera noltii swards has been recorded on the south and east coasts (Goodman et al. 1959; Bird & Ranwell 1964; Hubbard & Stebbings 1968) and Chapman (1959) mapped such a process in North Cockle Bight at Scolt Head between 1932 and 1959. At that site, Z. angustifolia on very soft mud was not invaded; neither is there any evidence that S. anglica has anywhere replaced Z. marina which occurs at lower levels than Z. noltii. At Keysworth in Poole Harbour, a Ruppia maritima-Potamogeton pectinatus community has been replaced by S. anglica (Hubbard & Stebbings 1968). S. anglica can flourish at the same level as the Sali-cornietum europaeae and, as a result, pioneer vegetation https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.010 Published online by Cambridge University PressSM6 Spartinetum townsendii salt-marsh 41 of this kind is now of local occurrence throughout south-east England. The extent to which S. anglica invades other existing marsh communities is uncertain. Pans and creeks invegetation higher up the marsh may be grown over and scattered plants are widespread throughout marshes, but the wholesale replacement of other communities isnot well documented. Chater & Jones (1957) provide some evidence for a slow advance into Puccinellietum maritimae and Juncetum gerardi in the Dovey estuary but this is not apparent at many sites. Similarly there islittle evidence as to how much invasion into S. anglica swards takes place from contiguous communities. On grazed marshes in the Dovey, creek levees have becomecolonised by Festuca rubra which has eventually ousted S. anglica; because of the frequency of creeks there, the total area of marsh affected is considerable (Chater 1973). Heavily grazed and poached upper levels of S. anglica have elsewhere been invaded by Puccinellia maritima. It is not known how far the development of a S. anglica community to seaward of an existing marsh complex affects the overall nature of the marsh but it might be expected that alterations in drainage would be of prime importance. In general, S. anglica has consolidated its early initial spread but the patchy degeneration of sward which became known as 'die-back' was noticed as early as 1928 and in some sites has made a considerable impression. It is still mainly restricted to Channel coast marshes and its exact cause remains unknown. Pathogens and pollutionhave been ruled out (Goodman et al. 1959) and it seems possible that the process is caused by a toxic reduced inorganic ion (perhaps sulphide) produced in anaerobic waterlogged root environments (Goodman & Williams 1961). Alternatively, the switch from accretion to abla-tion under S. anglica may be responsible for its demise. Distribution "

"sm8","Zonation and succession Salicornia stands may form a distinct zone in the lower marsh, sometimes hundreds of metres deep. At some sites, particularly those on sandy substrates, patches of Salicornia may be separated from the main marsh front by several hundred metres of bare flat. The community can also occur in a mosaic with the Puccinellietum marit-imae or with the Spartinetum townsendii. The expansion of the latter has much reduced the area of lower marsh available for pioneer Salicornia establishment especiallyin south-east England. Although the annual Salicornietum is generally thelowest marsh community proper it may rarely initiate a succession because summer accretion can be offset by ablation after the stands have disappeared in the winter. Chapman (1957) has, however, produced a cartographic record of changes in the distribution of Salicornia marsh at Scolt Head, Norfolk with ageing of open and closed marshes. Distribution "
"sm9","Zonation and succession The habitat diversity of the community makes it difficult to generalise about the successional status of the com-munity.

Distribution "
"u1","Zonation and succession The Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland usually survives now as fragments among mosaics of sub-shrub vegetation, bracken, scrub and woodland on lowland heaths where, after often long and complex treatment histories, response to neglect is generally the major factor in determining the pattern of communities. In other places, reclamation of such landscapes has been so complete as to leave small stands of the grassland isolated on more intractable or temporarily disturbed ground among intensive pasture, arable or forestry plantations, with some kinds of urban wasteland providing new habitats in a totally artificial context. All the more valuable, then, are those places where the community persists as a fairly extensive element of open, semi-natural scenery, as in parts of Breckland where there is the added interest of wide variation in soil conditions. Even in this most continental environment, the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland is largely a plagioclimax community ultimately dependent on grazing for its survival. In this light, the community can be regarded as the usual product of clearance and long-continued pasturing over parched, acid soils through the drier lowlands of Britain, where it has been closely associated with heath vegetation, grazing and burning maintaining the characteristic patchwork of communities. The particular kinds of heath with which the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland is still found are, however, quite diverse, its own distribution spanning the ranges of a variety of distinct sub-shrub communities. Through its heartland, in East Anglia, it characteristically occurs with the Calluna-Festuca heath in the extensive grassheath mosaics of Breckland and the Suffolk Sandlings and among the drier vegetation of the Norfolk Commons; here the Typical, Erodium-Teesdalia and Cornicularia-Cladonia sub-communities come espe cially close to the heath in their floristics. Further south, on the commons of the wetter Weald, the Potentilla-Galium sub-community becomes frequent and its usual sub-shrub companion is the Calluna-Ulex minor heath; and then, in the South-West Peninsula, along the Welsh coast, up the Marches and around the south-western Pennine fringes, this is replaced by the Calluna-Ulex gallii heath, a community which recurs in close association with the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland at scattered localities around the East Anglian coast. The Hypochoeris sub-community is also found with the Calluna-Ulex gallii heath in some of its cliff-top stations around the south-western seaboard, where the sub shrub vegetation is often of the Scilla sub-community. Such situations are scarcely maritime in the strict sense and, where there is any salt-spray influence, the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland is replaced by the Armeria-Cerastium maritime therophyte community. All these sub-shrub communities are dry heaths and the various kinds of Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland essentially represent their herbaceous element, in which the ericoids and gorse species are kept in check by the continual predation of herbivores. The proportions of grassland and heath at any site, and the sharpness of the boundaries between the vegetation types, are thus ulti mately dependent upon the disposition and intensity of the grazing, with burning episodes offering periodic opportunities for the grassland to gain ascendancy over the heath on shallower soils where pasturing after the fire is heavy. Even then, however, the parched and impoverished character of the ground prevents the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland developing the kind of vigorous post-burn sward that is produced over moister soils in central southern and south-western heaths by Agrostis curtisii. Except in very extreme situations, the continuing open nature of the vegetation means that, if grazing and burning cease, colonisation by woody plants tolerant of the dry and oligotrophic conditions readily occurs. With the almost universal abandonment of traditional heath management, then, and after the demise of rabbits, the contribution of the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland has generally shrunk, with a spread of heath and direct invasion of the sward by Betula pendula and pines, these latter able to seed in from nearby plantations, with Quercus robur sometimes appearing or, more locally, as at Sandringham Warren, Rhododendronponticum. Even where the shade is not too dense, the grassland species mostly succumb quite quickly and there is little doubt that most stands of the community would progress eventually to Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland, the climax forest of acid and free-draining soils through lowland Britain and variously dominated by oak, birch or pine. The other very common element of the neg lected heath landscape is bracken, although Pteridium aquilinum tends to avoid soils subject to pronounced parching and to make little headway in direct expansion into the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland. Typically, then, the community now persists mainly on patches of more inhospitable ground where invaders cannot flourish, along pathways and around trampled picnic spots and viewing points among dense patchworks of rank heath, bracken and woodland. Periodic disturbance may allow a resurgence of the Festuca-https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.036 Published online by Cambridge University PressUl Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Rumex acetosella grassland 309 Agrostis-Rumex grassland but, where the ground becomes enriched, such places are likely to be directly invaded by Ulex europaeus to form Ulex-Rubus scrub, or by brambles to produce Rubus-Holcus or Pteridium-Rubus underscrub, or by rank grasses and tall herbs, all of which shade out the smaller plants of the grassland. Towards the wetter part of its range, it is often among such vegetation types as these that the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland persists in rocky field corners and in the disturbed ground around settlements, forming part of the untidy patchwork of semi-natural vegetation typical of landscapes which have seen marginal improvement for grazing. Through the drier lowlands, reclamation has been more extensive and drastic, though it often came late because of the inherent diffi culties which the soils pose for good cropping, being lime-and often copper-deficient, droughty and liable to wind erosion. But they are readily cultivated and, par ticularly in East Anglia, have often gone to arable, mostly for sugar-beet and barley (Hodge et al. 1984). Afforestation has also been an attractive alternative where agricultural yields are low and, in the first 30 years of its existence, the Forestry Commission had acquired 40% of Breckland where by far the largest and most interesting stands of the community survived. There, then, the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland often remains as fragments on the wider sandy ridges between plantations of pine, or in the corners of ploughed fields which have escaped planting and treatment with chemical fertilisers and herbicides. Stands taken in to airfields and military training grounds sometimes preserve more extensive and semi-natural zonations and mosaics by virtue of the prohibition on such improving activities, and the community can develop over a surprising range of man-made surfaces there. Within urban or industrial areas, too, in the warm dry lowlands, the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland can occur over sharply-draining derelict ground among a wide variety of more eutrophic grasslands, tall-herb vegetation and scrub. Where the most extensive stands of the community remain, in parts of Breckland, there is the additional striking influence of variations in base-richness among the sharply-draining, impoverished soils depending on the proximity to the surface of the underlying Chalk and the amount of calcareous material among the superfi-cials (Figure 31). Such differences exert the major control over the renowned suite of grass-heaths, first fully described by Watt (1936,1940), and grouped in this scheme within the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland (Watt's A and B swards) and the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland (D-G). The zonations, which can be seen still in whole or part, on the Lakenheath-Elveden, Icklingham and Stanford-Wretham heaths (Ratcliffe 1977), run from the most calcifuge swards on Redlodge humo-ferric podzols, through transitions over Worl-ington and Methwold sands, to the most calcicole on Newmarket brown rendzinas (Corbett 1973, Hodge et al. 1984). Where Calluna-Festuca heath occupies the more acidic profiles, its boundaries are generally very obvious but zonations among the grasslands can be very gradual or form complex mosaics, often depending directly on heterogeneity in the superficials; where graz ing has been relaxed, the boundaries often become further blurred by expansion throughout of F. ovina. Even in the close-cropped swards, some of the perennials and many of the ephemerals and cryptogams run throughout but the preference of Thymus praecox, T. pulegioides, Leontodon hispidus, Cirsium acaule, Sanguisorba minor, Avenula pratensis and, less obviously, Koe leria macrantha, is for the Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland; and that of Rumex acetosella, Teesdalia and Galium saxatile is for the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland. In some Breckland sites, too, Carex arenaria can become prominent among these mosaics, marking a shift to Carex or Car ex-Cladonia dune communities where sand has been eroded and re-deposited (Watt 1937, Noble 1982), with some possibility of redevelop-Figure 31.

"u10","Zonation and succession The Carex-Racomitrium community often terminates altitudinal sequences of sub-shrub heaths and various kinds of chionophilous vegetation disposed over slopes and summits in relation to exposure to wind and cold. Flushing with snow-melt or spring waters can result in transitions to dwarf-herb communities or soligenous mires, and on some high-level plateaus the moss-heath grades to blanket bog over thickening ombrogenous peat. Increasingly, towards the less oceanic parts of eastern Scotland, the various elements in these patterns are replaced by their continental equivalents, and to wards lower altitudes there is a strong tendency for the vegetation types to be influenced by grazing. In the typical oceanic sequence of low-and middle-alpine heaths, well seen over the long quartzite ridge of Foinaven in the north-west Highlands, where each of the communities descends to particularly low levels, the striking feature is the abundance of R. lanuginosum throughout the zonation. Over the summit, the Carex-Racomitrium heath can be found in its most fragmentary form on the stony ablation surfaces, but this thickens up to more extensive tracts of the Silene sub-community with a little shelter, and this in turn gives way below to a zone of the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath. There is frequently strong floristic continuity between the vege tation types, particularly in those places where the Carex-Racomitrium heath loses some of its contingent of cushion herbs and becomes more like the Typical form, and where, as is usual over more windswept slopes, the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath is represented by the more lichen-rich Cetraria sub-community. Then, species such as C. bigelowii, F. ovinalvivipara, D. flex uosa, Cladonia uncialis, C. arbuscula and Cetraria islandica occur often throughout and, although V. myrtillus and, more distinctly, Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum increase in frequency and abundance eventually becoming co-dominant with R. lanuginosum, this development may be at first very ill-defined. Among the lower reaches of the Carex-Racomitrium heath, for example, the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath can occur in small patches over stretches of block scree or in shallow hollows, looking very much like a sub-shrub facies of the moss-heath (Poore & McVean 1957). In other places, a more sudden shift on to steeper, bouldery ground can be matched by a clearer boundary between the vegetation types. On Foinaven and some other mountains in the northwest Highlands, as over the Affric-Cannich Hills, the broad altitudinal zonation continues downwards with the replacement of the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath by its heather-dominated equivalent, the Calluna-Racomitrium heath. In other places, as on the western half of the Creag Liath ridge on Ben More Assynt, this latter community passes more directly to the Carex-Racomi-trium heath: again, the transition can be fairly gradual, but Calluna is typically unable to survive at the higher altitudes of the moss-heath and such species as C. bigelowii and Diphasium alpinum become increasingly frequent above. A further complication of this pattern is seen where the Calluna-Arctostaphylos alpinus heath occupies some of the more windswept slopes below the Carex-Racomitrium heath, as on high spurs in the Fannich Hills, but with its wind-clipped mat of A. alpinus and Loiseleuria procumbens, among Calluna, V. myrtillus and E. nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum such vege tation is usually very distinct. With the geographical shift eastwards, the competitive ability of R. lanuginosum in these zonations becomes increasingly curtailed, especially over more severely exposed slopes through the low-and middle-alpine zones, where less oceanic heaths, usually with an abundance of lichens, replace their western equivalents. And, away from the eroded and intermittently irrigated abla tion surfaces of the north-west Highlands, the Carex-Racomitrium heath is more often of the Typical form. Good zonations, juxtaposing oceanic and continental communities, can be observed on Ben Wyvis and, in the west-central Highlands, over the Drumochter Hills, both sites with very extensive moss-heaths over their summit plateaus. Here, Typical Carex-Racomitrium heath passes below to Calluna-Cladonia heath, often through a mosaic in which fragments of each vegetation type are included within a ground of the other (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962), though with a general shift in dominance among the cryptogams from R. lanuginosum to a variety of lichens, and the appearance of wind-clipped Calluna with a little V. myrtillus and E. nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum. On other mountains, as over parts of the Monadhliath plateau, these latter sub-shrubs figure more prominently in the zone below the Carex-Racomi-trium heath, forming stands of the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath, in which lichens are often even more overwhelmingly abundant than in the heather-dominated counterpart. Zonations of both these types can be seen in and around the Cairngorms, too: above Glen Feshie, for example, there are some especially fine sequences of the former sort, and on the outlying spurs of White Mounth and Cairn Bannoch in Lochnagar some of the latter. Over much of the high plateaus here, though, and particularly in the eastern Cairngorms, the Carex-Racomitrium heath is replaced by the Juncus-Racomitrium heath, where the more continental character of the flora extends on to the fell-fields. The two vegetation types occur together in some places, most extensively on the summits of Lochnagar, where gentle transitions between them can be widely seen: usually a move from the Carex-Racomitrium heath to the other community involves a reduction in the abundance of R. lanugino-https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.045 Published online by Cambridge University PressUlO Carex bigelowii-Racomitrium lanuginosum moss-heath 411 sum, an increase in the cover of lichens and much more frequent tussocks of Juncus trifidus. Here, the Juncus-Racomitrium heath represents the equivalent of the most open stands of the Silene sub-community of the Carex-Racomitrium heath on the western Highland ablation surfaces. Throughout its range, a frequent complication of these zonations involves the occurrence of various kinds of chionophilous vegetation wherever there is an increased tendency for snow to accumulate and persist in hollows or over slopes that have a little more shelter than is usual for the moss-heath. The widest range of snow-bed communities in our mountains is, in fact, found where the Carex-Racomitrium heath is least common and extensive, through the east-central Highlands, although stands can be found there which contain patches of the Salix-Racomitrium and Carex-Polytrichum communities, and quite a variety of more chionophilous vegetation of this sort occurs among Carex-Racomitrium heath on the summit of Aonach Mor. Such snow-beds are generally very distinct from their sur rounds, with their characteristic abundance of snow-tolerant mosses like Racomitrium heterostichum, Dicranum fuscescens, Polytrichum alpinum and Kiaeria star kei, species which are never more than local in the Carex-Racomitrium heath, but much more widespread and often less well defined are transitions to stands of the Nardus-Carex grass-heath. In that vegetation, Nardus stricta and sometimes also Scirpus cespitosus and Juncus squarrosus can be abundant on ground that is left moist as the snow melts, but there is strong floristic continuity between the communities with frequent records for C. bigelowii, D. flexuosa, G. saxatile, V. myrtillus and Cladonia uncialis, as well as R. lanuginosum which can remain quite extensive provided snow-lie is not too lengthy or irrigation very heavy. Such zonations can be seen in hollows within stretches of the moss-heath or where there is a shift to more sheltered slopes in sites like the Drumochter Hills, Beinn Dearg and Ben Wyvis, and, at lower levels, where snow-lie is not so prolonged, the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath can also figure in transitions to less exposed ground, particularly where the drainage is free and the ground more bouldery or craggy. In the north-west Highlands, the more chionophilous elements in these kinds of sequences are somewhat different. There, stretches of ground which hold snow for long periods within or adjacent to stands of the Silene sub-community often have moss-rich Deschampsia-Galium vegetation, where mixtures of Rhytidiadelphus loreus, Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi dominate the ground carpet and where D. cespitosa becomes common, and small patches of these species on intermittently irrigated ground within the Carex-Racomitrium heath can represent the beginnings of a transition to such late snow-beds. Alternatively, over slopes flushed with melt from such fields, the more grass-rich kind of Deschampsia-Galium vegetation may replace the Silene sub-community. Over somewhat more calcareous substrates, modest flushing may bring some base-enrichment to the Silene sub-community which can presage a switch to the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia dwarf-herb vegetation. A. alpina, T. praecox, S. procumbens and C. bigelowii all remain common there, but R. lanuginosum is usually replaced by R. fasciculare or R. canescens which, with Poly tri chum alpinum and Oligotrichum hercynicum, make up the bulk of the moss carpet. Mosaics of the two communities can be seen over windswept ground on the Moine schists or limestone of the Monar Forest hills and on Ben Alder, and over Dalradian schists on Creag Mhor. Then, on Ben Lawers, a mountain which has little gentler exposed ground at high levels but where some patchy Carex-Racomitrium heath can be found, there are transitions to both the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia vege tation and, in somewhat drier situations, the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene dwarf-herb community. On other sites, flushing of stands of Carex-Racomi-trium heath may be with more base-poor waters, when there are springs of the Philonoto-Saxifragetum or Pohl-ietum glacialis or soligenous vegetation like the Carex-Sphagnum russowii mire. These are usually clearly enough marked off from the surrounding moss-heath, although they are sometimes found as part of complexes of high-level bog vegetation within which boundaries are much less well defined. Over the summits of the Drumochter Hills, for example, and on some of the Affric-Cannich Hills, the Carex-Racomitrium heath can pass fairly gradually into the Vaccinium-Hylocomium sub-community of the Calluna-Eriophorum blanket mire with a thickening cover of ombrogenous peat. Although such plants as Eriophorum vaginatum, Rubus chamaemorus, Sphagnum capillifolium and 5. papillosum, as well as Vaccinium myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, V. uliginosum and Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum, characterise such vegetation, over mire margins there is sometimes strong continuity through R. lanuginosum, various lichens, C. bigelowii and D. flexuosa. Where the Carex-Racomitrium heath extends into regions of less extreme climate, as towards lower alti tudes around the western seaboard of Scotland, through the Southern Uplands and northern England, it generally occurs as the Galium sub-community in zonations which have a much less sharply alpine character than those described above. In the Moffat Hills, for example, on the Cairnsmore of Fleet and over Cross Fell, this kind of Carex-Racomitrium heath can pass below to sub shrub vegetation which approaches montane heath in its composition but which is usually some sort of Calluna-Vaccinium or Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, lichen-rich https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.045 Published online by Cambridge University Press412 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities in more exposed situations, or with an abundance of hypnaceous mosses in the more sheltered. Colder, damper aspects can have stands of the latter community which come close to chionophilous bilberry heath and locally there may be patchy Nardus-Carex heath where snow is held a little longer than usual. A further complication in these regions is that, increasingly with the shift to lower altitudes, there is a tendency for these sequences of vegetation types to be affected by grazing: this reduces the peculiar features of the different communities, encouraging a spread of grasses and grazing-tolerant dicotyledons throughout, tramples out more sensitive mosses and lichens and sometimes favours the appearance of mesophytes in response to manuring. Such a trend is already visible in the Galium sub-community and, where more ill-defined stands of this occur above zones of Nardus-Galium and Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grasslands, there seems little doubt that the whole vegetation pattern has been long affected by its use as rough pasture over unenclosed mountain slopes. Generally speaking, the Carex-Racomitrium heath is a climax community but it is probably quite vulnerable to cropping, trampling and manuring, being fairly readily converted to some kind of Vaccinium-Deschampsia grass-heath and then perhaps to Nardo-Galion grassland at more moderate altitudes. Over higher ground, ptarmigan may sometimes find palatable herbage in stretches of Carex-Racomitrium heath, but the community is otherwise little affected by biotic factors. Erosion by wind and the effects of soli fluction may help create new ground for colonisation by this kind of vegetation and it is possible that cycles of degeneration and regrowth occur in some places (Smith 19116, Tansley 1939, Pearsall 1950), but there is little actual evidence for this, and such processes may be very fragmentary and readily set back. Distribution "
"u11","Zonation and succession The Polytrichum-Kiaeria community is usually found as part of suites of chionophilous vegetation types over snow-bound slopes through the middle-alpine zone, where floristic variation can be related to duration of snow-lie, the drainage of melt-waters, the stability of the ground and the base-richness of substrates and irrigating waters. With the geographical shift northwestwards, some elements of these patterns change and the Polytrichum-Kiaeria community itself eventually peters out. The variety and extent of late snow-bed vegetation is greatest of all in the Cairngorms where this and closely-related communities are especially well developed over the north-and east-facing slopes within the transition from the more chionophilous of the Nardus-Carex swards to the wind-blasted Juncus-Racomitrium fell field of the summits. Here, hollows and slopes with long-persistent snow can have discrete patches of one or other of the Polytrichum-Kiaeria and Salix-Racomitrium com munities, mixtures of the two occurring zoned over more and less snow-bound and stable ground, or forming intimate mosaics with little apparent relation to topography. The balance in the carpet between such bryophytes as K. starkei, R. heterostichum and Gymnomitrion concinnatum often has to be relied upon to discern boundaries but, with the vagaries of climate from season to season and its sometimes unpredictable effects on the substrate, the disposition of the plants of these commu nities is not always what might be expected (Poore 1955c). And, indeed, we still have so little information about these kinds of vegetation that we remain uncertain how to interpret even the more stable patterns. The Polytrichum-Kiaeria carpets are often sodden with water after the melt, but where distinct springs issue from the snow-beds, patches of the Pohlietum glacialis or sometimes the Sphagno-Anthelietum can occur, usually clearly marked off by the abundance of their particular dominant bryophytes, the striking applegreen P. wählender gii n&v. glacialis or the great swollen masses, dull and glaucous, of A. julacea. Then, over intermittently irrigated ground fed by such permanent springs or melt-water, there can be stands of the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia dwarf-herb community. This shares with the Polytrichum-Kiaeria vegetation such species as D. cespitosa, C. bigelowii, A. alpina, Sibbaldia, O. supina, Nardus, Polytrichum alpinum and various Racomitrium ssp., but K. starkei is very scarce there and mosses in general are less abundant than in the snow-bed. Another common feature of many of these patterns in the Cairngorms is the Cryptogramma-Athyrium community, also strongly chionophilous, but characteristic of stretches of bouldery ground such as run around the steeper back of snow-beds. The abundance of ferns usually dis tinguishes such vegetation, but there is sometimes strong continuity with the Polytrichum-Kiaeria community through D. cespitosa, S. stellaris and asso ciated bryophytes (Figure 36). Figure 36. Complex of vegetation types around a late snow-bed in the Cairngorms. Polytrichum-Kiaeria snow-bed U9 Juncus-Racomitrium rush-heath U18 Crypto gramma-Athyrium fern community M32 Philonoto-Saxifragetum with M33 Pohlietum spring at its head https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.046 Published online by Cambridge University Press420 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities Surrounding these very distinctive complexes there is often some kind of Nardus-Carex heath, sometimes with an intervening zone of Carex-Polytrichum vegetation, whose extensive carpets of P. alpinum and Dicranum fuscescens can give a strong measure of structural continuity to the swards. The Nardus-Carex heath, extensive stretches of which can clothe moderately snow-bound slopes, is generally grass-or sedge-dominated, but it can provide fairly gradual transitions from the Polytrichum-Kiaeria snow-bed to sub-shrub heaths in the low-alpine zone below and to Juncus-Racomitrium fell-field above. Moving out of the Cairngorms, many elements of these sequences remain important over the highest snowy ground on other mountains through the central Highlands. In some places, later snow-bed vegetation is very well represented, while in others it is less extremely chionophilous communities that predominate and, away from the Cairngorms, the Carex-Racomitrium heath replaces the Juncus-Racomitrium heath on very exposed plateaus above the snow-beds. But good stands of Polytrichum-Kiaeria vegetation can be found with some or all of the other communities mentioned above on Lochnagar, Creag Mhor and Ben Heasgarnich, Ben Lawers, Beinn Laoigh and Ben Alder (Ratcliffe 1977). Increasingly towards the more oceanic mountains of the north-west, however, the balance among these vege tation types shifts somewhat, with the Deschampsia-Galium community becoming ever more important where there is moderately long snow-lie or pronounced irrigation by melt-water. Fragmentary stands of mossrich Deschampsia-Galium snow-beds can be seen in a few places south of the Great Glen, west of Creag Meagaidh and Ben Heasgarnich, but through the Affric-Cannich and Fannich hills and the Monar Forest, this vegetation replaces the Carex-Polytrichum heath around the margins of really late snow-patches with the Polytrichum-Kiaeria community. There are frequent records for D. cespitosa, C. bigelowii, Galium saxatile, Polytrichum alpinum and R. lanuginosum throughout these swards, but usually an obvious shift to hypnaceous mosses as dominants in the moss-carpet of the Des champsia-Galium vegetation. Also through the northwest Highlands, grassier stands of this community often extend down below the snow-beds over low-alpine slopes with either a moderate cover of snow or free through-put of melt-water and rain, frequently forming mosaics with chionophilous sub-shrub heaths over bouldery ground or peaty soils. Eventually, in the northern Highlands, the Polytrichum-Kiaeria community becomes ever more fragmentary in these complexes and around Ben More Assynt and Foinaven, it is usually mosaics of Deschampsia-Galium and Nardus-Carex vegetation that constitute the most chionophilous ele ments of the patterns. Distribution "
"u12","Zonation and succession The Salix-Racomitrium community is characteristically found with other kinds of chionophilous vegetation over the most snow-bound slopes of the middle-alpine zone, where zonations and mosaics are influenced by the length of snow-lie, the drainage conditions, solifluction and the base-richness of the substrate and irrigating waters. Moving north-westwards from the central Highlands, there are some changes in the vegetation patterns, with the Salix-Racomitrium community itself eventually disappearing. The most complete range of late snow-beds through the range of this community is to be seen over the cold and sunless north-and east-facing slopes on the lee side of the Cairngorms, within hollows and corries in the transition zone from grass-and sedge-heaths to summit fell-field. In some cases, the Salix-Racomitrium community is the most chionophilous of the range of vegetation types represented, in others it occurs with patches of Polytrichum-Kiaeria moss-heath, the latter marking out ground that is obviously influenced by longer snow-lie still, though generally free of the downwash or solifluction that are characteristic here. Then, a clear shift in dominance from Racomitrium spp. or G. concinnatum with S. herbacea to K. starkei may help to delineate the boundaries between the communities. Often, though, where both communities are represented, the patterns are not so well defined as this, nor so readily related to differences in the snow-bed environment, and the Silene-Luzula type of Salix-Racomitrium moss-heath in particular can grade imperceptibly into the Polytrichum-Kiaeria community. Mosaics are especially complex where there has been some disruption in the usual balance of conditions, with, say, a shorter or longer snow-lie than average, or some recent downwash of detritus on to an established carpet, events which are perhaps more the rule than the exception in this harsh environment (Poore 1955c, McVean & Rat cliffe 1962). The Salix-Racomitrium vegetation, and especially the Silene-Luzula sub-community, characteristically re ceives intermittent irrigation by melt-waters and downwash from rain, and, where there is a transition to less snow-bound ground which has such periodic flushing, it can pass to the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia dwarf-herb community. The two vegetation types share frequent records for such species as C. bigelowii, L. spicata, S. acaulis, Nardus, D. cespitosa, Polytrichum alpinum, R. fasciculare and R. lanuginosum, but the overall contribution from bryophytes is less in the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia community, and there it is mixtures of Alchemilla alpina, Sibbaldia and grasses which characteristically dominate. Also, where the flushing waters bring a measure of base enrichment, plants like Thymus praecox and Selaginella selaginoides make a frequent appearance over the irri gated surrounds to the snow-beds, though this is less a feature in the Cairngorms than where the Salix-Racomi-trium community occurs over more calcareous sub strates, like the Dalradian mica-schists of the Breadalbane range. There, such transitions can be seen among chionophilous swards and montane calcicolous vege tation on Ben Lawers and, more extensively, on Beinn Laoigh (Ratcliffe 1977). In other places, locally through the more northerly mountains of the central Highlands, the Salix-Racomi-trium vegetation can be found in close association with the Carex-Polytrichum heath, a less chionophilous community but one in which there is a similar abundance of mosses, usually in this case Polytrichum alpi num and/or Dicranum fuscescens. This, in turn, can grade to stretches of the Nardus-Carex grass-heath, various kinds of which form a widespread context for late snow-beds of both the Salix-Racomitrium and Poly trichum-Kiaeria communities over moderately snowbound slopes. Towards lower altitudes, the Nardus-Carex heath generally gives way to a zone of sub-shrub vegetation, within which a more mildly chionophilous influence can extend down among low-alpine communities. Above, it typically gives way over the exposed summit plateaus of the Cairngorms to the Juncus-Racomitrium fell-field, among which small patches of the Salix-Racomitrium community can survive wherever there is sufficient shelter to catch and hold a little snow for long periods. Particularly distinctive here are the stands of the Gymnomitrion sub-community which occur within the depressed centres of Juncus trifidus tussocks. Even within the east-central Highlands, there is a tendency away from the very bleak tops of the Cairngorms for the Juncus-Racomitrium fell-field to be re placed by the Carex-Racomitrium moss-heath and, to wards the west, stands of the Salix-Racomitrium heath usually pick out later snow-beds in the transitional zone from this summit vegetation to the Nardus-Carex heath below. Moving westwards, too, the Cryptogramma-Athyrium community becomes a more widespread feature of complexes of chionophilous vegetation. It can be found in the Cairngorms, but in the western Highlands occurs much more commonly as a fringe over stabilised block scree around the back of corries or over stretches of boulder-strewn ground on sheltered slopes. In species such as K starkei, Polytrichum alpinum, R. lanuginosum and Diplophyllum albicans, the Salix-Raco-mitrium vegetation may show some continuity with the mossy understorey of the Cryptogramma-Athyrium https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.047 Published online by Cambridge University PressU12 Salix herbacea-Racomitrium heterostichum snow-bed 427 community, but the prominence of the ferns generally serves to mark out stands of the latter. Also within the Cryptogramma-Athyrium vegetation, there is a rise to prominence of hypnaceous mosses which, towards the western Highlands, and particularly beyond the Great Glen, become increasingly prominent in the carpet of more chionophilous heaths. Even within the central Highlands, the Deschampsia-Galium community can figure locally over irrigated slopes around Salix-Racomitrium snow-beds, but north of the Affric-Cannich Hills it tends to replace the Carex-Polytrichum heath around the margins of the longer lying snow patches. And, beyond Beinn Dearg, where the Salix-Racomitrium community peters out al together, the Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of the Deschampsia-Galium grassland is often the most chionophilous vegetation of the sheltered and sunless slopes. Gradual transitions and some stands intermediate between this and the Salix-Racomitrium community occur in some places, but the difference in dominance in the moss carpet is usually clear. On fell-fields in the north-west Highlands, patches of ground with a little snow cover and some amorphous solifluction which, in the central Highlands, would have the Gymnomitrion sub-community of the Salix-Racomitrium vegetation, carry the Silene sub-community of the Carex-Racomitrium heath within which there may be occasional records for G. concinnatum. Distribution "
"u13","Zonation and succession The Deschampsia-Galium grassland is usually found among patchworks of other chionophilous vegetation types where floristic variation depends on such factors as length of snow-lie, freedom of drainage for irrigating waters and the amount of solifluction. Regional and local climatic differences through the range of the community influence the different components of these sequences and there is some possibility of a mediation through grazing of transitions to tail-herb vegetation. In some places, it is possible to see Deschampsia-Galium vegetation continuing upwards an altitudinal sequence of grassy swards from the sub-montane zone into the low-alpine. On Beinn Laoigh, for example, further north over parts of Creag Meagaidh and, to the north-west, in the Monar Forest and the Fannich and Letterewe Hills, mosaics of the Nardus-Galium and Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grasslands occur extensively over the lower slopes and, where these run up to the irrigated ground below snow-bound corries, transitions to the Anthoxanthum-Alchemilla sub-community are found. The strong dominance of D. cespitosa in many stands of the latter is usually sufficient to mark them out clearly, but more mixed grassy covers are quite widespread in this vegetation and then boundaries may be less well defined. Co-dominance of Nardus and D. cespitosa is sometimes seen, for example, and transitions to the Luzula-Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland can be especially gradual. In other places, where the ground below corries becomes more gently sloping and increasingly waterlogged, the Anthoxanthum-Alchemilla sub-community passes fairly sharply to Juncus-Festuca grassland, wet heath and blanket mire. More commonly, though, the Deschampsia-Galium grassland occurs among zonations of sub-shrub vege tation, grass-and sedge-heaths and snow-bed communities that are related partly to altitude, partly to the degree of local shelter and partly to edaphic factors such as freedom of drainage and the base-richness of the irrigating waters. The characteristic pattern through the central section of the western Highlands is well seen over the Affric-Cannich and Fannich Hills and, to a lesser extent, in the Monar Forest and, further south, on Bidean nam Bian in Argyll. Here, both kinds of Des champsia-Galium vegetation are widespread and the two can sometimes themselves be found in a gradation upslope, the Anthoxanthum-Alchemilla sub-community passing, often gently, to the Rhytidiadelphus heath with a switch in dominance from D. cespitosa to hypnaceous mosses. Often in this region, too, the community occurs with some type of Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, re placing it with increased altitude and duration of snowlie, or alternating with it over slopes that show some variation in the pattern of irrigation. The occurrence of porous block scree tumbling down hillsides, for example, can provide an environment buffered from the impacts of snow-melt and run-off and such areas often have stands of the Hylocomium-Rhytidiadelphus sub community of the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, rich in hypnaceous mosses and with a vascular cover of grasses with Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum, the abundance of these last and the waning importance of D. cespitosa helping to define the boundaries. Much more locally through the north-west Highlands, the Deschampsia-Galium grassland can be found in similar situations with the hepatic-rich form of the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath, this being especially characteristic of very sheltered and shady areas among boulders. Differences in the amount of irrigation, particularly through the summer, probably play a part, too, in the disposition of the Deschampsia-Galium grassland in relation to the Nardus-Carex grass-heath, a community that is often found with it over moderately snow-bound slopes. The two have many species in common, notably Nardus, F. ovinalvivipara, Alchemilla alpina and hypnaceous mosses, and both grassier and more mossy Des champsia-Galium swards can grade to different sub communities of the Nardus-Carex grass-heath. The Rhytidiadelphus type comes especially close because there the dominance of D. cespitosa, which helps provide a general distinction, is much less pronounced. Where the Deschampsia-Galium grassland, or mix tures of the two above communities, form a fringe around later snow-beds in this part of the western Highlands, they usually give way, where snow-lie is longer, to the Polytrichum-Kiaeria heath. Characteristically, this is a moss-dominated vegetation, with species such as K. starkei usually very abundant and Polytrichum sexangulare and Oligotrichum hercynicum a con stant feature, and herbs such as Saxifraga stellaris and Omalotheca supina common. None of these occur more than very occasionally in the Deschampsia-Galium https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.048 Published online by Cambridge University PressU13 Deschampsia cespitosa-Galium saxatile grassland 435 community, but D. cespitosa, C. bigelowii and Alchemilla alpina can run on with some frequency into the late snow-bed and, where they remain patchily abundant, blur the boundary between the vegetation types. D. cespitosa, A. alpina, G. saxatile, D. flexuosa, R. loreus and P. alpinum also all remain very common in another strongly chionophilous community frequent in this part of the Scottish Highlands, the Cryptogramma-Athyrium vegetation, but mixtures of C. crispa and A. distentifolium typically dominate there and stands almost always mark out stretches of block scree, patches of tumbled boulders or rocky ledges. More difficult to delineate precisely, or to interpret environmentally, are transitions to the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia community which are commonly seen in these mountains over the irrigated ground around late snowbeds. Mixtures of A. alpina and S. procumbens are the usual dominants, sometimes with Minuartia sedoides, Thymus praecox and Omalotheca supina in modest abundance, but grasses can be quite plentiful, among them D. cespitosa, A. capillaris, Anthoxanthum and Nardus, and there may be quite prominent patches of hypnaceous mosses. Such stretches of ground are often fed by the distinctive kinds of snow-bed springs, the Pohlietum glacialis or Sphagno-Anthelieturm scattered shoots of D. cespitosa are frequent in such vegetation but the striking dominance of the respective bryophytes is usually sufficient to mark them out clearly. Finally, in this kind of pattern, the Deschampsia-Galium vegetation, in the form of the Rhytidiadelphus sub-community, frequently extends up to its highest altitudinal limits as small stands marking out sheltered hollows in Carex-Racomitrium heath, the characteristic moss-dominated sward of exposed summits in the more oceanic parts of the Highlands. Separation from stretches of the Typical sub-community of this vege tation, the most widely distributed form, is usually fairly easy, the change from abundance of R. lanuginosum to hypnaceous mosses being well defined. But increasingly towards the north-west, the Carex-Racomitrium heath is represented by the Silene sub-community where, under conditions of severe exposure, the carpet of R. lanuginosum often becomes fragmented, and where intermittent irrigation from snow-melt is marked by patches of R. loreus, P. schreberi and H. splendens and diminutive tussocks of D. cespitosa. The high frequency of mats and cushions of plants such as Salix herbacea, Silene acaulis, Thymus praecox and Armeria maritima generally helps define the Carex-Racomitrium heath but, over ablation fields, the cover is often broken and heterogenous and intimate mosaics of this vegetation with mossy Des champsia-Galium snow-beds can be seen. In shifting northwards, the balance among the ele ments in these sequences changes somewhat. The Polytrichum-Kiaeria snow-bed, for example, can be seen with the Deschampsia-Galium community as far north as Beinn Dearg and Ben Wyvis, but even on Beinn Eighe and the Letterewe Hills, and more obviously on Ben Hope, Foinaven and Ben More Assynt in Sutherland, the Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of the Deschampsia-Galium vegetation is often among the most chionophilous swards. It is in this part of the Highlands, too, that the similarities and contrasts between the community and the tall-herb Luzula-Geum vegetation, mediated perhaps by climatic and edaphic conditions, perhaps also by grazing, are to be seen in the swards disposed over slopes and ledges of the corries. D. cespitosa, Alchemilla alpina, Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum, D. flexuosa, G. saxatile, R. acetosa and hypnaceous mosses all remain very frequent in Typical Luzula-Geum vege tation and there are transitional stands in which D. cespitosa occurs with particular abundance. But, generally, it is a subordinate plant in the tall-herb stands, and there is typically a good representation of species such as Luzula sylvatica, Geum rivale, Rhodiola rosea, Angelica sylvestris, Filipendula ulmaria and Succisa pratensis, and a ground carpet in which Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus, Thuidium tamariscinum, Plagiomnium undulatum and Rhizomnium punctatum are very common. Comparable transitions to this can also be seen where the substrates and seeping waters tend to be more base-poor, when the tall-herb vegetation is generally of the Luzula-Vaccinium type. Again, here, D. cespitosa may remain frequent and locally of modest abundance, but V. myrtillus, Dryopteris dilatata, Blechnum spicant and Gymnocarpium dryopteris are usually very frequent and, apart from the hypnaceous mosses, the floristic overlap is less than with the Luzula-Geum community. East of Creag Meagaidh and Ben Heasgarnich in the central Highlands, the Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of the Deschampsia-Galium grassland becomes very fragmentary and is replaced geographically in moderately late snow-beds by the Carex-Polytrichum sedgeheath. Both kinds of vegetation are to be seen together on Creag Meagaidh and Ben Alder and in some localities, on Ben Lawers for example, there are quite extensive tracts of heath of a somewhat intermediate character (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). Also in the central Highlands, on Ben Alder and Beinn Laoigh, are some snow-bound slopes where the Deschampsia-Galium community can be found with Salix-Racomitrium snowbeds as well as those of the Polytrichum-Kiaeria type, but there is usually little difficulty in distinguishing the patches of this strongly chionophilous vegetation with its cover of dwarf willow and diagnostic bryophytes. Further east, the Anthoxanthum-Alchemilla sub community continues to find a place beyond the range of the Rhytidiadelphus sub-community among sequences of moderately chionophilous heaths and grasslands, as around Lochnagar and Caenlochan (Huntley 1979), but https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.048 Published online by Cambridge University Press436 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities it is a minor element in such patterns and sometimes looks very much like a replacement for tail-herb and fern vegetation that has been derived by grazing. Distribution "
"u14","Zonation and succession The Alchemilla-Sibbaldia community is a widespread, though usually not very extensive, element among suites of more chionophilous vegetation of the low-to middle-alpine zones throughout the Highlands. The associated communities vary somewhat according to differences in regional climate, but the most important factors influencing the disposition and extent of the vegetation types are the duration of snow-lie, the pattern of drainage of melt or flushing waters, the stability of the ground and the base-richness of the soils. Some stands may be influenced by grazing, but this is essentially a climax community. Through much of its range, the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia vegetation occurs in association with the Polytrichum-Kiaeria or Salix-Racomitrium late snow-beds and the permanent springs of the Pohlietum glacialis, three extremely chionophilous communities whose overall distributions are roughly coincident with this. Sometimes the patterns are quite well defined with the snowbeds occupying the centres of hollows or the most sheltered and shaded slopes of corries, and patches of the Pohlietum marking the spring heads with the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia vegetation over the irrigated ground below and around these, and sometimes running up behind where a cornice of snow is held around the corrie rim. In other cases, where snow persists patchily over a slope, with sporadic flushing over uneven ground between and below the late beds, the mosaics may be more complex and the elements less sharply delineated. Typically, the Polytrichum-Kiaeria and Salix-Racomitrium communities are distinguished by an abundance of more chionophilous mosses like K. starkei, P. sexangulare, Oligotrichum hercynicum and Racomitrium heterostichum which are hardly ever extensive in the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia swards. However, prominent patches of R. fasciculare may occur throughout the zonation and such characteristic species as Alchemilla alpina, Omalotheca supina and Luzula spicata, even Sibbaldia on occasion, can run on with high frequency and local abundance over the more snow-bound ground. Quite often, too, and particularly towards the lower limits of the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia community in the low-alpine zone, the moderately chionophilous Nardus-Carex grass-heath is found with this vegetation, melt water from its snow cover frequently providing the source of irrigating waters. Here, the abundance of Nardus and C. bigelowii, more locally of Scirpus cespito-sus, sometimes with a carpet of R. lanuginosum or hypnaceous mosses, will usually serve as a marker of the boundaries. Less easy to differentiate in many cases is the Deschampsia-Galium community which increasingly towards the west occupies at least some of the low-and middle-alpine slopes covered by fairly long-lying snow or irrigated by melt from it. Where D. cespitosa is strongly dominant in such vegetation, as is quite often the case on less snow-bound ground, the two communities are usually distinct, but there is strong floristic continuity between them and less luxuriant Deschampsia-Galium swards can grade smoothly into Alchemilla-Sibbaldia vegetation where irrigation becomes somewhat more sporadic and the soils rather less stable. Mosaics of all these communities, together with fern-https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.049 Published online by Cambridge University PressU14 Alchemilla alpina-Sibbaldia procumbens dwarf-herb community 443 dominated stands of the Cryptogramma-Athyrium snow-bed on stretches of block scree, are very characteristic of the upper snow-bound slopes of the Fannich and Affric-Cannich hills, Beinn Dearg, and to a lesser extent of the Monar Forest, though there the more chionophilous elements tend to be fragmentarily developed. Northwards from this part of Scotland, moss-dominated stands of the Deschampsia-Galium community tend to occupy the latest snow-beds and around Letter-ewe and Ben More Assynt Alchemilla-Sibbaldia vege tation can be found on irrigated ground around these, grading to the centre with an increase in hypnaceous mosses and a loss of less chionophilous herbs. Beyond here, however, the community becomes of very patchy occurrence on the mountains of the far north-west. Moving south across the Great Glen into the central Highlands broadly similar patterns to those described above can be seen on Bidean Nam Bian, Ben Alder and Creag Meagaidh, though to the east of here, the Des champsia-Galium vegetation tends to be replaced in the sequences by the Carex-Polytrichum sedge-heath, the swards of which are usually quite distinct from the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia community. The Alchemilla-Sibbaldia vegetation itself continues to be well represented even into the drier east-central Highlands, where it is an important element in the varied and extensive suites of chionophilous vegetation over the northern slopes of the Cairngorms. The other striking kind of zonation which is best seen in the central Highlands involves transitions between the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia community and other more calcicolous vegetation types of moderately snow-bound slopes and irrigated ground. The Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene community in particular is very close in its floristics and physiognomy and is most often found with Alchemilla-Sibbaldia vegetation over the limestones and calcareous mica-schists of the Breadalbane Mountains. It is distinctly more calcicolous in its total flora, though it is often the abundance of less demanding species like Silene acaulis and Minuartia sedoides that provide the most obvious indication of its extent, with Sibbaldia taking their place on moving into the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia community. And environmentally, it is the longer duration of snow lie that determines the shift to the latter vegetation type. Quite often the sequence continues into stands of the distinctive montane flush vegetation of the Caricetum saxatilis on waterlogged ground in hollows or around permanent Cratoneuron-Festuca springs. Continuously irrigated slopes can have rich stands of Deschampsia-Galium grassland and where more inac cessible banks or ledges occur the dwarf-herb stands can pass to the luxuriant Luzula-Geum or Dryas-Silene communities or dripping Saxifraga-Alchemilla vegetation. Freedom from grazing often mediates the shift to tall-herb assemblages and the Alchemilla-Sibbaldia swards may sometimes experience some cropping and trampling. Ultimately, though, it is climatic and edaphic conditions which maintain the community as a climax. Distribution "
"u15","Zonation and succession The Saxifraga-Alchemilla community is typically found in zonations and mosaics with other kinds of calcicolous montane vegetation, where floristic variation is related mostly to differences in soils, and the intensity of grazing and trampling by stock, factors which are often com pounded as topography becomes less rocky and inac cessible. It is a climax community under the very particular conditions which favour its development. Such conditions are usually maintained over only limited areas, so Saxifraga-Alchemilla banks are typically of but small extent, continuous stands rarely stretching for more than 20 m2. A common situation is for carpets of this vegetation to festoon the steep drip ping faces of little rocky outcrops in tracts of grassland or parts of more extensive crags, gully sides and cliffs of corries. Often, the sheer abundance of S. aizoides is sufficient to mark off the community from the bare or vegetated surrounds, but gradual transitions from these banks to a variety of other vegetation types are frequent. Especially gentle are those changes which can be seen where fractured brows grade into continuous grassy swards over the surrounding slopes, vegetation which is often strongly flushed, though not kept so thoroughly wet as the rock faces, and which is also frequently grazed, particularly towards the lower altitudes. Where the ground is more or less equally calcareous over such transitions, with continuity of bedrock or with base richness maintained by the seepage, the typical vege tation around is the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, the major plagioclimax pasture of the sub-montane and sub-alpine zones. Particularly distinctive of higher altitude and more strongly flushed slopes carrying this vegetation is the Saxifraga-Ditrichum sub community. This shows very strong floristic continuity with the Saxifraga-Alchemilla community through fre quent records for S. aizoides, S. oppositifolia, Alchemilla glabra, A. alpina, Festuca rubra, F. ovinalvivipara, Sela ginella, Deschampsia cespitosa, Carex pulicaris, Polygonum viviparum, Pinguicula vulgaris, Thymus praecox and Ctenidium molluscum and in some cases it is very hard to discern a boundary between the two vegetation types. In general, though, the pattern of dominance is different, the balance lying with grasses and small sedges in the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus swards; and there are usually rather more frequent records there for mesophytic herbs like Viola riviniana, Plantago lanceolata and Prunella vulgaris. Rather similar flushed stands of Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grassland can also be found in some places juxtaposed with the Saxifraga-Alchemilla community, but the continuity of more demanding calcicoles is much less marked there, and S. aizoides and S. oppositifolia rarely extend far into such swards. Open, stony flushes over steeper ground among such grasslands, strongly irrigated with base-rich waters, typically support the Carici-Saxifragetum, a calcicolous small-sedge mire that also has much in common floristically with the Saxifraga-Alchemilla community. S. aizoides itself is a constant there and often an abundant plant, and there are frequent records, too, in the Thalic-trum-Juncus sub-community characteristic of higher altitudes, for Alchemilla alpina, A. glabra, Selaginella, Carexpulicaris, Pinguicula vulgaris, Thalictrum alpinum, Polygonum viviparum and various of the basiphile bryophytes common on dripping cliffs. Where vigorous flushes emerge adjacent to rock faces and in gullies with https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.050 Published online by Cambridge University PressU15 Saxifraga aizoides-Alchemilla glabra banks 449 Saxifraga-Alchemilla vegetation, fairly gradual transitions between the communities can be seen, or confusing mosaics of open, gravelly banks and unusually lush patches of mire, a feature well seen in the samples which Huntley (1979) collected from Caenlochan. Again, how ever, the pattern of dominance in the two vegetation types is generally different, with sedges like C. demissa, C. panicea, C.flacca and C. dioica, as well as C.pulicaris, having a more important role in the Carici-Saxifrageturn. Also, there, Juncus triglumis is much more common and J. articulatus, which is hardly ever found in the Saxifraga-Alchemilla community, is constant. Bryophytes like Campylium stellatum and Drepanocladus revolvens become very frequent, too, along with Blindia acuta, Aneura pinguis and Bryum pseudotriquetrum. Patchworks of all these vegetation types are a common feature of many of the mountains between Beinn Laoigh and Clova, and of those localities further to the north-west where exposures of calcareous rocks provide more than just very isolated cliffs with basiphile vegetation among extensive stretches of Nardo-Galion grasslands and grass-heaths. In some places, too, as on the higher ground of Ben Lawers, and around Ben Heasgarnich, the Saxifraga-Alchemilla community can be seen grading to the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene dwarfherb vegetation on the skeletal mull soils which develop over drier gentler slopes or from the finer detritus that tumbles or slumps from cliffs and banks. In some senses, this is a low-alpine counterpart to the kinds of transitions to grasslands that are seen over the slopes at lesser altitudes, although here moderate snow-lie and solifluction are important additional factors in keeping the vegetation of the sheltered and less resistant ground open and rich in competition-sensitive Arctic-Alpines. Plants like Silene acaulis, Sibbaldia procumbens and Minuartia sedoides are thus very common in the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene vegetation, along with Luzula spicata, Omalotheca supina and Salix herbacea and, with the virtual disappearance of Saxifraga aizoides, Pinguicula vulgaris and Carex pulicaris, the distinction between the communities is usually clear. However, S. oppositifolia remains frequent in the dwarf-herb swards and where it is this saxifrage as much as S. aizoides that characterises the Saxifraga-Alchemilla vegetation, along with prominent Alchemilla alpina, Thymus praecox, Selaginella and more abundant hypnaceous mosses than usual, the separation of the communities may be less easy, particularly over crumbling cliffs of mica-schist. Even in the harsh montane environment of these higher slopes, grazing may play some part in maintaining the open character of dwarf-herb vegetation but where more inaccessible ground, often still craggy like that beneath Saxifraga-Alchemilla banks, but not so moist, occurs among the dripping cliffs, the Dryas-Silene community can be seen. This very rich and luxuriant vegetation typically has a mat of smaller herbs including Saxifraga aizoides, S. oppositifolia, Alchemilla alpina, Selaginella and Thymus as well as many of the grasses and bryophytes of the Saxifraga-Alchemilla banks, but such woody plants as Dryas octopetala, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, V. myrtillus, V. uliginosum and the Arctic-Alpine willows Salix reticulata and S. arbuscula occur as an open and uneven cover, and there is a variety of taller herbs. Transitions between these vegetation types can be seen on the cliff faces and ledges of Beinn Laoigh. Elsewhere on damp ledges, stable but ungrazed and with calcareous to neutral soils, the Saxifraga-Alchemilla carpets can merge with the Luzula-Geum community. Again, in its finest development, this can be extraordinarily rich and luxuriant with a great abundance of tall herbs that gives an unmistakable look to the vege tation, but less distinctive stands can be found and, with frequent records for Saxifraga aizoides, Alchemilla glab ra, Pinguicula vulgaris and Bryum pseudotriquetrum among a carpet of Deschampsia cespitosa, Luzula sylvatica, Festuca ovinalvivipara and F. rubra with scattered Geum rivale and Rhodiola rosea, there can be a fairly gradual transition to adjacent Saxifraga-Alchemilla banks. Over more precipitous and ledge-free cliffs, each of these vegetation types can become fragmented into heterogenous and peculiar assemblages which it is diffi cult to characterise. However, one fairly distinct transition of this kind can be seen where more extensive carpets of Saxifraga-Alchemilla vegetation give way to small pockets of chasmophytes rooted in rock crevices. The composition and patterning of such assemblages is often a close reflection of the lithology and structure of the particular exposure, but harder limestones often have some form of Asplenium-Cystopteris vegetation. Plants such as the saxifrages, Thymus, Oxyria and Rhodiola can occur scattered through the fragments of this community but it is generally ferns like Asplénium viride, A. trichomanis, A. ruta-muraria, Cystopterisfragi-lis and Polystichum lonchitis, together with basiphilous bryophytes, that are the most prominent elements. Distribution "
"u16","Zonation and succession The Luzula-Vaccinium community is sometimes found among grasslands and heaths where variations in graz ing intensity or frequency of burning over open slopes and summits have determined the vegetation pattern. Very often, though, the protection necessary for the maintenance of the community depends on topographic discontinuities which set stands apart from the sur rounding vegetation in stretches of broken, rocky ground. In such situations, the Luzula-Vaccinium community can sometimes occur with other tail-herb and fern-dominated assemblages, differences in soils determining the mixture of vegetation types, or with patches of scrub if there has been an opportunity for further succession. Throughout the range of the community, and especially in the more oceanic west, the Anthoxanthum-Festuca sub-community can be found in zonations and mosaics over open slopes with a variety of grassland types. It is particularly distinctive over summits at moderate altitudes around the Atlantic seaboard of Scotland (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962) and on some cliff-top sites (e.g. Prentice & Prentice 1975), but it also occurs on hillsides and in smaller valleys and gullies. Often, such stands are little islands isolated within extensive tracts of other swards, but larger stretches of this kind of Luzula-Vaccinium vegetation are to be seen in some places, even quite far from the west of Scotland, as in the Moffat and Ettrick hills, and on Ben Loyal in Sutherland whole corries slopes are covered with the Anthoxanthum-Festuca sub-community (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Ratcliffe 1977). The great abundance of L. sylvatica is usually sufficient to provide a clear boundary between the vegetation types, despite the strong continuity among the associates, although a number of grasslands show patchy prominence of the club-rush, and then it may be hard to delimit the elements of transitional mosaics. These often involve Nardus-Galium or Festuca-Agrostis-Galium swards, par ticularly through the Southern Uplands, and in both of these the Nardo-Galion grasses, dicotyledons and bryophytes preferential to the Anthoxanthum-Festuca sub community thicken up to form the bulk of the turf. On peatier soils in wetter areas, like the western Highlands, and particularly where slopes receive much run-off from precipitation or snow-melt, the Anthoxanthum-Festuca sub-community is found more often in close association with the Deschampsia-Galium grassland, with which there is again marked similarity among the associates, though which is typically dominated by D. cespitosa. Moderately snow-bound slopes where there is some drainage impedence can show a shift from the Anthoxanthum-Festuca sub-community to some kind of Nar dus-Carex vegetation from which L. sylvatica is generally excluded by lack of free water movement, and with the shift to exposed summits at high altitudes, this kind of Luzula-Vaccinium vegetation can give way to Carex-Racomitrium heath. Throughout these zonations, variations in grazing intensity and the occurrence of burning can mediate transitions to a variety of sub-shrub com munities. Towards lower altitudes, these are usually of the Calluna-Vaccinium or Calluna-Erica types, with Calluna-Racomitrium and Vaccinium-Racomitrium dwarfed heaths figuring on higher ground where exposure to wind and snow become important determining influences on the vegetation cover. In each case, increase in abundance of sub-shrubs other than V. myrtillus, and the eventual eclipse of L. sylvatica, are enough to mark the boundaries between the vegetation types. An altitudinal zonation from the Anthoxanthum-Festuca sub community, through Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath to summit Carex-Racomitrium heath is a striking feature of the rather unusual vegetation cover of Ben Loyal (Rat cliffe 1977). Species-poor Luzula-Vaccinium vegetation quite fre quently replaces the Anthoxanthum-Festuca sub community in patterns of the above types, but it can also be seen on ledges and among blocky talus, separated from surrounding communities by bare rock, or by stretches of open water where it occurs on islands. It is in such situations, too, that the Dryopteris-Dicranum sub community is characteristically found, and there are places where a gradually more inaccessible topography is marked by a zonation from close-cropped Nardo-Galion swards, through a fringe of the Anthoxanthum-Festuca sub-community to the Dryopteris-Dicranum sub-community, with increasing luxuriance of the vege tation and the appearance of the more grazing-sensitive herbs. Occasionally, such a transition may run on into patchy scrub, with saplings of birch or rowan marking out fragmentary Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland or, at higher altitudes, Arctic-Alpine willows increasing https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.051 Published online by Cambridge University PressU16 Luzula sylvatica-Vaccinium myrtillus tall-herb community 457 their cover to dominate in a stand of Salix-Luzula scrub. In each case, the Luzula-Vaccinium vegetation can run on virtually unchanged to form the field and ground layers of these communities. In other sites, particularly on north-or east-facing slopes, where shade, shelter and the persistence of snow maintain especially cool and humid conditions, the Dryopteris-Dicranum sub community can mark out the most inaccessible areas of ground among mosaics of Deschampsia-Galium grassland and Calluna-Vaccinium-Sphagnum heath, with the latter of which the Luzula-Vaccinium community can show strong continuity in its associated herbs and bryophytes. Quite often, however, the Dryopteris-Dicranum sub community is completely isolated from the more accessible grasslands and heaths. Frequently, it occupies entire ledges or tracts of bouldery ground, though where there is some heterogeneity in the rocks making up the cliffs or screes, or variation in the quality of flushing waters seeping from them, there can be transitions to other kinds of grazing-sensitive vegetation. A shift to more base-rich and mesotrophic soils, for example, marking out exposures of calcareous sedimentaries or lime-rich intrusions or shatter zones, or some local base-rich seepage into largely impoverished soils, can see a shift to the Luzula-Geum community, with its richer and more basiphilous flora, or patches dominated by ferns. The close proximity of varied communities of this general kind was a feature of the ledges described from North Hoy by Prentice & Prentice (1975) and it is seen to spectacular effect on the giant ledge of Beinn Bhan, where streaks and patches of the different vegetation types mark out drier zones and seepage patches. Distribution "
"u17","Zonation and succession Usually, the inaccessibility necessary for the development of the Luzula-Geum community means that stands occur set apart from the grasslands and heaths of surrounding montane slopes among tracts of broken, rocky ground. Other herb and fern-dominated communities can share such ledge and cliff habitats, the vegetation types disposed according to variations in base richness and wetness of the soils and the amount of exposure to wind and frost, with patchy occurrence of scrub representing the but sporadic succession to woody vegetation that is possible in isolated ungrazed situations in the sub-alpine zone. At lower altitudes towards the more oceanic west of Scotland, serai progression to sub-montane scrub is more probable, although burning is especially likely there to convert stands to heath. The floristic and structural contrasts between the Luzula-Geum vegetation and its grazed counterparts on moist, base-rich and mesotrophic soils at similar alti tudes are seen most clearly and instructively in the Breadalbane range and around Caenlochan in the Grampians, where corries and their adjacent slopes cut into calcareous rocks offer sites which are to varying degrees inaccessible to stock and deer. In these moun tains, the Geranium sub-community occupies many of the most isolated ledges and crags where there is some shelter, with Deschampsia cespitosa-^ommeAQ^ swards on irrigated and often moderately snow-bound, though stable, hillsides around. The less basiphilous of this vegetation, developing where seepage is insufficient to offset leaching, can be included in the Deschampsia-Galium grassland, the Anthoxanthum-Alchemilla sub community of which has occasional records for some of the characteristic Luzula-Geum herbs. Very often, though, the soils are sufficiently calcareous and mesotrophic to support richer vegetation than this over the open slopes, swards which experience at least some grazing, are grass-dominated with herbs nibbled down to rosettes, but often qualitatively indistinguishable from the Agrostis-Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of the Luzula-Geum vegetation. This is what McVean and Ratciffe (1962) characterised as species-rich Deschamp-sietum caespitosae alpinum, and it forms a virtual continuum with tall-herb stands of the community where there is a gradual increase in slope or increasing frag mentation of the ground into systems of ledges running out on to cliffs. In other places, the Geranium or the somewhat less rich Agrostis-Rhytidiadelphus sub-community, are found sharply separated by expanses of bare rock from Deschampsia-Galium swards or more high-altitude tracts of anthropogenic Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus or Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grasslands where the sur rounding grazed slopes are but modestly flushed. Sometimes, the Luzula-Geum vegetation occupies all available ledges in such cliff and ravine systems, but quite often there is some variety in the cover. Geological differences across outcrops, for example, or variations in the extent of flushing, can result in the juxtaposition of tall-herb stands of contrasting composition, more base-poor and oligotrophic soils often showing a shift to the Luzula-Vaccinium community. Such patterns are especially well seen through the western Highlands, where calcareous rocks tends to be of more localised occurrence. On Ben Hope, for example, calcareous hornblende schists provide some local enrichment in granulite outcrops, while in the Letterewe Forest there are Serpulite Grits and Fucoid Beds among Lewisian gneiss. Then, on the Bens Griam and North Hoy in Orkney, variations in Old Red Sandstone, and on Skye differences in Tertiary basalts can show this kind of variation (Birks 1973, Prentice & Prentice 1975, Ratcliffe 1977). Most cele brated of all, perhaps, is the variegation in the tall-herb cover on the great Coire na Poite ledge on Beinn Bhan, where base-rich seepage from the Torridonian Sandstone cliffs is marked by stripes of the Luzula-Geum community among stretches of Luzula-Vaccinium vege tation. The differences between the two assemblages can be very striking, with the much greater richness of https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.052 Published online by Cambridge University Press468 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities basiphile and mesophytic herbs in the Luzula-Geum community, but intergradations do occur, and increasingly towards the more oceanic west of Scotland, the great abundance of ferns in ungrazed vegetation often masks floristic variation among the smaller associates. The Primula-Hypericum sub-community in particular, the predominant form of the Luzula-Geum vegetation at lower altitudes through the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland, can come very close in its composition to the Luzula-Vaccinium community (Spence 1960, Prentice & Prentice 1975). On more calcareous mountains, as through Breadalbane, the Luzula-Geum vegetation is often the only tail herb community, but differences in the amount of seepage and the degree of exposure can mediate transitions to other kinds of cliff and knoll vegetation. Where irrigation with base-rich water over rock faces is strong and constant, for example with soils and herbage kept in a dripping-wet condition, the Luzula-Geum community is typically replaced by the Saxifraga-Alchemilla vege tation. The Alchemilla-Bryum sub-community can be seen as transitional to this, and plants such as Des champsia cespitosa, Alchemilla alpina, A. glabra, Carex pulicaris, Thalictrum alpinum, Polygonum viviparum, Ranunculus acris, Ctenidium molluscum and Bryum pseudotriquetrum continue to be very frequent, with other species like Geum rivale, Rhodiola, Oxyria and Luzula sylvatica also occurring occasionally. But in the Saxifraga-Alchemilla vegetation, dominance generally passes to S. aizoides and S. oppositifolia, which form sopping banks, hanging down over rock faces and earth slopes, with the other herbs scattered through. Some other plants, like Pinguicula vulgaris, Parnassia palustris, Blindia acuta and Aneura pinguis, also become very much more common. A very different kind of transition, though equally characteristic of the calcareous crags of the Breadalbane mountains, is seen where ungrazed ledges become more exposed to the effects of fierce winds and, being blown clear of snow, to winter frosts. In such places, the Dryas-Silene community is the typical kind of vegetation, its varied patchworks of basiphile dwarf shrubs, tall herbs, cushion plants, grasses, sedges and bryophytes reflecting the skeletal, calcareous nature of the soils, subject to much freeze-thaw and solifluction. Some plants, like Succisa, Angelica, Geranium sylvaticum, Alchemilla alpina, A. glabra, montane Hieracia, Geum rivale, Fili-pendula ulmaria, Rhodiola, Saussurea and Luzula sylvatica can, by virtue of their locally luxuriant growth, give a measure of continuity between the Dryas-Silene community and the Luzula-Geum vegetation. Usually, however, where sheltered ledges pass above to windswept brows or, with a shift of aspect, are replaced by more exposed shelves of rock, the floristic and physiognomic changes are very striking. Many of the bulkier plants either disappear or become stunted in their growth and other species, crowded out among the tail herb growth, are much more frequent: in particular, Dryas octopetala, Thymus praecox, Silene acaulis, Ditrichum flexicaule and Tortella tortuosa become a constant feature among the low carpets of these bleak crags. Transitions from such vegetation to grazed swards around are often marked by a switch to the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene community, a parallel pattern to that involving the Luzula-Geum and Deschampsia-Galium communities, and mosaics of all four vegetation types are a memorable feature of parts of Ben Lawers, Meall Ghaordie, Beinn Laoigh and Caenlochan-Clova (Rat cliffe 1977). Arctic-Alpine willows, particularly Salix lapponum, occasionally find a place in stands of both the Luzula-Geum and Dryas-Silene communities on high-altitude crags, and there seems little doubt that such colonisation can be a step towards the development of Salix-Luzula scrub, the climax woody vegetation of the low-alpine zone in the Scottish Highlands. In fact, invasion of this kind is often very problematic, because seed-parents are widely scattered, frequently growing in single-sex populations (Poore & McVean 1957), colonisation sites like wise very local and growth upon them perhaps so luxuriant as to prevent germination of fertile seed. Commonly, then, the Luzula-Geum community at these altitudes is an effective climax vegetation. At lower levels, towards the western seaboard of Scotland, there is less climatic restriction on the succession of ungrazed tail-herb vegetation to scrub or woodland, although again seed-parents are often very local in their distribution. A likely development here, from the Primula-Hypericum sub-community, would be some kind of Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland, probably dominated by Sorbus aucuparia and Betula pubes-cens: indeed, saplings of these are sometimes found in tail-herb vegetation in this region. Distribution "
"u18","Zonation and succession The Cryptogramma-Athyrium community is usually found as a visually distinct but quite integral component of suites of chionophilous vegetation types disposed over snow-bound slopes of varying rockiness, steepness and stability at higher altitudes through the Scottish Highlands. With the geographical shift eastwards, the community becomes much more local and there are some changes among the other elements represented in these patterns. Wherever snow-bound slopes in the low-and middle-alpine zones are interrupted by crags or brows of acidic rocks, bouldery patches or tracts of block scree which retain their snow cover long and deep, the Cryptogramma-Athyrium community is likely to be represented, particularly through the western Highlands. Stands can be very small, just a few square metres in extent, or up to several hectares, although such bigger stretches tend to be rather heterogeneous, resolving into mosaics on closer inspection. Sometimes, the context for the community is some kind of high-altitude grassland or grass-heath, covering the less rocky slopes around, from which snow is blown clear or melts away earlier in the spring. The Nardus-Carex community, for example, commonly occupies moderately snow-bound slopes with impeded drainage up to about 900 m throughout the range of the Cryptogramma-Athyrium vegetation, and is often found on gentler and less sharply draining ground around it. With its heathy mixtures of Nardus and Carex bigelowii, however, and occasional local abundance of Scirpus cespitosus, the Nardus-Carex community is usually well defined. Closer in composition and especially associated with the fern beds through the western Highlands, is the Deschampsia-Galium grassland, which includes swards of peaty soils on cold, flushed slopes where snow-melt is often a major source of the irrigating waters. Ferns occur occasionally in this kind of vegetation, and small patches of the Cryptogramma-Athyrium community can mark out lit tle groups of boulders within it. Moreover, with plants like Deschampsia cespitosa, D. flexuosa, Galium saxatile, Alchemilla alpina, Viola palustris, Rumex acetosa and bulkier mosses occurring frequently in both vegetation types, the similarities between them are sometimes very obvious, and there can be some interlocking where thin stretches of turf run in among blocky talus around the edges of screes. These kinds of pattern can be seen over the upper less calcareous exposures on Beinn Laoigh, on Bidean nam Bian, Beinn Eighe, Beinn Dearg, through the Affric-Cannich, Fannich and Letterewe hills and, in more fragmentary fashion, on Ben More Assynt to the north. It is in these mountains, too, that the floristic similarities between the Cryptogramma-Athyrium community and more oligotrophic tail-herb ledge vege tation are most apparent, and over the corrie slopes, screes and ledges of sites like Beinn Bhan, Beinn Eighe and the Letterewe Forest, the fern beds can be found in close association with both the Luzula-Vaccinium vege tation and Deschampsia-Galium swards perhaps partly derived from them by grazing. A. distentifolium can be locally abundant in the Luzula-Vaccinium community, as on the Coire na Poite ledge on Beinn Bhan, where flushing in an equable climate compensates for the shelter and humidity provided by longer snow-lie, and in such situations it can be quite hard to distinguish the vegetation from Cryptogramma-Athyrium beds. Through the western Highlands, the moss-rich Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of the Deschampsia-Galium grassland often represents the most chionophilous kind of vegetation on gentler unbroken slopes with humic rankers and podzols kept wet and cold throughout the year by irrigation with melt and run-off. Where the Cryptogramma-Athyrium community occurs on rocky brows around such late snow-beds or among patches of boulders which are disposed between hollows, it is generally clearly defined by the abundance of ferns, but there can be a strong continuity between the ground carpet of the two vegetation types, with R. loreus, H. splendens, Racomitrium lanuginosum, Polytrichum alpi num and Barbilophoziafloerkii frequent throughout. To the west of Creag Meagaidh and Ben Heasgarnich, where the Cryptogramma-Athyrium community is very local on snow-bound bouldery ground in the Cairngorms and on Lochnagar, the Deschampsia-Galium snow-beds are replaced by the Carex-Polytrichum type, swards which are not so strongly chionophilous as the fern beds, but sometimes found juxtaposed with them on gentle, ill-drained ground that carries longer snow cover than is usual for the Nardus-Carex grass-heath. Deschampsia cespitosa, D. flexuosa and bryophytes such as Polytrichum alpinum, Dicranum fuscescens and Racomitrium lanuginosum provide a measure of continuity here, but Carex bigelowii is usually at least a co dominant in the swards and ferns are hardly every found. Through much of the range of the Cryptogramma-Athyrium community, however, it is the Polytrichum-Kiaeria vegetation that is its most consistent companion in the very latest snow-beds. This comprises bryophyte-dominated swards with an abundance of mosses and hepatics that find, at most, a sparse representation in the fern beds, species such as Kiaeria starkei, Polytrichum https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.053 Published online by Cambridge University PressU18 Cryptogramma crispa-Athyrium distentifolium snow-bed 481 sexangulare, P. alpinum, Oligotrichum hercynicum and Barbilophozia floerkii providing most of the ground cover, with but sparse occurrence of vascular plants like Deschampsia cespitosa, Saxifraga stellaris and Omalo-theca supina and only very rare records for ferns. Typically, this vegetation occupies the sodden humic soils that cover quite steep slopes, snow-bound well into the late spring, through the middle-alpine zone. The ground is stable, though not rocky, and the community generally passes very sharply to the Cryptogramma-Athyrium vegetation where there is a bouldery surround above the snow-bed. More unstable soils, equally snow-bound, but subject to frost-heave and solifluction, may have the Salix-Racomitrium community, characterised by crusts of Salix herbacea and bryophytes, and mosaics of this and the Polytrichum-Kiaeria vegetation often occur together on the slopes below patches of the Cryptogramma-Athyrium vegetation. Through much of the range of the"fern stands of this kind, the summit plateaus above the middle-alpine snow-beds have Carex-Racomitrium heath or fell-field, with the Juncus-Racomitrium heath replacing this through the Cairngorms.

"u19","Zonation and succession The Thelypteris-Blechnum community is usually found among grasslands, heaths and woodlands in zonations and mosaics which reflect differences in soils, local climate and treatments. In successional terms, this kind of vegetation is probably serai to oak-birch or pine forest, though many stands persist in an apparently stable condition, particularly towards higher altitudes. The general context for stands of this community is a patchwork of grasslands and heaths dispersed over stream banks and valley sides. The Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, the major plagioclimax sward of base-poor soils through the uplands, is a common element where there is grazing in such mosaics, with the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla or even the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland represented where irrigation brings a measure of base-enrichment to the slopes. T. limbosperma can persist in such swards but the major element of continuity is among plants like F. ovina, Agrostis spp., Anthoxanthum, Potentilla erecta, G. saxatile, V. riviniana, O. acetosella and the bryophytes which can form a matrix in more grassy stands of Thelypteris-Blechnum vegetation, then coalesce into a continuous turf with a shift into the grassland. Similar mosaics and gradations occur where the community is found among heaths occupying base-poor soils that are more sharply draining or ground that is regularly burned. These vary according to the particular region and local climate, the Calluna-Erica heath being the characteristic associate at lower altitudes in more oceanic areas, the Calluna-Vaccinium heath in more montane settings, and there eventually giving way above to Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath. In such situations, it is species like V. myrtillus, Calluna, G. saxatile, Blechnum, the grasses and bryophytes which provide continuity among the vegetation types, clumps of T. limbosperma again persisting patchily in the transition zones. Through the sub-montane parts of the uplands, such vegetation types represent treatment-derived replacements for forest and the occurrence among them of the Thelypteris-Blechnum community can often be regarded as a transitional stage in succession. Over most of the range of this kind of vegetation, it is Quercion oak-birch woods that represent the climax on the moist, base-poor soils characteristic here, with the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland on the less impoverished ground, the Quercus-Be tula-Dicranum on the more oligotrophic. Thelypteris-Blechnum stands can be found in close association with these forest communities, sometimes forming a fringe around their upper margins, and occur with scrubby fragments in ravines and along stream sides. Towards the eastern Highlands, the community is also found among Pinus-Hylocomium forest and Juniperus-Oxalis scrub which is serai to pine there though often persisting as a perpetually renewed relic. Luxuriant fern-dominated patches are a striking feature of ungrazed enclaves among such juniper scrub in places like Mor-rone (Huntley & Birks 1979a,b) and also, further south, in Upper Teesdale (Graham 1971, Gilbert 1980), and the Viola-Anemone sub-community of Juniperus-Oxalis scrub can be virtually a Thelypteris-Blechnum stand with https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.054 Published online by Cambridge University PressU19 Thelypteris limbosperma-Blechnum spicant community 485 an associated juniper canopy. Both T. limbosperma and J. communis ssp. communis, seem to favour the relief from stagnation and extreme base-impoverishment that irrigation brings, though of course a dense fern cover is inimical to establishment of juniper seedlings. At higher altitudes, or even on lower slopes where seed-parents are in short supply, the Thelypteris-Blechnum community can persist without progressing further. Distribution "
"u2","Zonation and succession The Deschampsia grassland is most often found with sub-shrub vegetation, woodland, scrub and bracken in mosaics which reflect complex histories of land use, particularly forest clearance, burning and grazing, and on lowland heaths it now often makes but a small contribution to remnants of semi-natural vegetation where neglect is the major controlling factor in community distribution. Soil-related sequences can sometimes still be discerned beneath the serai patterns, with the Deschampsia grassland occupying a transitional position between wet heath and ephemeral-rich grassland. Around the upland fringes, the patterns are essentially the same, though the particular vegetation types involved can be different and here, too, the grassland can occur in close association with mire communities. In The Weald, in such places as Iping Common in Sussex, Thursley, Hankley and Chobham Commons in Surrey (Ratcliffe 1977) and over some of the remaining open spaces around London, the Deschampsia grassland forms an integral part of the patchwork of communities that has developed over the more free-draining base poor soils with the abandonment of burning, grazing and other traditional treatments like the cutting of bracken and gorse. Much of the ground is now occupied by what was early referred to as 'oak-birch heath' (Tansley 1911, 1939, Wooldridge & Goldring 1953), that is, open, immature Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland with local dominance by a variety of invading trees. Birch, usually B. pendula, oak, mostly Q. robur but with Q. petraea locally abundant, and pine, particularly P. sylvestris but with other species seeding in from planted stock, are all important. And, on some Surrey sites, the naturalised alien Amelanchier lamarkii has gained a hold in such mosaics. In certain places, as on Holmbury and Leith Hill, dead heather and gorse among the woodland litter shows that such vegetation has succeeded heath over the past 40 years or so, while elsewhere trees have invaded more open ground directly after burning episodes. In other sites, there is overgrown Calluna-Ulex minor heath, dense bracken or, where there has been some disturbance and enrichment of the soils, Ulex-Rubus scrub. Among these mosaics, the Deschampsia grassland is sometimes limited to the margins of well-worn paths or remnants of more open ground where woody plants have not yet got a hold in the rank sward, and periodic fires can help re-instate the community in such situations. Sometimes, the stands are a little more extensive, but throughout there is always a strong floristic continuity among the various vegetation types represented, D. flexuosa itself running on under more open canopies of sub-shrubs and trees, together with herbs like Potentilla erecta and Galium saxatile, and the boundaries between the communities being often dependent upon the extent of the cover of woody plants. Frequently, now, the extent of this regrowth is suffi cient to blur any soil-related patterns in which the Deschampsia grassland is involved, but it can sometimes be seen as a partial replacement for the Calluna-Ulex heath in the sequences of communities over soils that are increasingly impeded. Then it gives way, where there is any strong tendency to gleying, to the Ericetum tetralicis wet-heath on periodically waterlogged peaty profiles. Such conditions are inimical to the survival of D. flexuosa, although where the surrounds of valley mires in this part of Britain have become dry and been burned the community can extend a little further than usual on to such ground. However, where there is any tendency for grass-dominance to develop in such situations west wards of The Weald, Agrostis curtisii usually has the edge on D. flexuosa, and the Deschampsia grassland fades in importance in the extreme oceanic zone. Shifting in the other direction in these edaphic sequences, on to base-poor soils that show a stronger tendency to parching than is usual under the Deschampsia grassland, there can be a local transition to the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland, usually, in The Weald, of the Poten-tilla-Galium sub-community. In the past, severe rabbitgrazing helped accentuate the contribution from this vegetation over scuffed patches and around burrows. Essentially similar mosaics of grassland, heath and woodland such as characterise The Weald can be found locally through the Midlands in such sites as Sherwood and Delamere Forests and over the higher ground in Cannock Chase, though here the sub-shrub vegetation is represented by the Calluna-Deschampsia heath, a community which shows an even greater floristic continuity with the Deschampsia grassland than does the Calluna-Ulex minor heath. Birch, oak and pine remain the major colonisers of the more open vegetation with Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland eventually establishing itself as the climax forest. With the shift to the upland fringes, some further https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.037 Published online by Cambridge University PressU2 Deschampsia flexuosa grassland 321 changes can be seen in this basic pattern. The Festuca-Agrostis sub-community of the Deschampsia grassland is replaced by the Vaccinium sub-community, and there are similar shifts in both the associated heath and woodland types, with bilberry-rich sub-communities becoming the norm, thus giving a somewhat montane character to the entire sequence of vegetation types. Usually these are disposed over the scarps and valley sides that mark the first substantial rise to the Pennine uplands, the mosaic of communities being again largely dependent on the history of treatments, with a widespread continuance of grazing helping to maintain extensive tracts of the Deschampsia grassland against the spread of sub-shrubs and trees. Patches of grassland and heath can recur at quite high altitudes on the grit edges, though wherever there is a lessening of slope with the shift on to the great shelving dips, poor drainage and the accumulation of ombrogenous peat curtail the extent of these communities. A common pattern is for the Deschampsia grassland to give way to Nardus-Galium grassland on the stagnopodzol intergrades, a zonation which can be interrupted by the occurrence of flushed areas with poor-fen vegetation like grassy Carex-Sphagnum mire, and then for there to be a switch to Calluna-Er iophorum bog. D. flexuosa can run throughout such sequences and, indeed, where blanket peats have been drained, the Deschampsia grassland itself can become established on the drier fringes and ramparts, with a local spread of V. myrtillus where grazing is withdrawn or of the unpalatable E. nigrum ssp. nigrum. The Deschampsia grassland can also figure over the drying surfaces of raised mires with the Erio-phorum bog, though with the shift into more oceanic areas it is Molinia which usually assumes dominance with the loss of waterlogging on the bog surface. Distribution "
"u20","Zonation and succesion The Pteridium-Galium community is a very common and often extensive element in zonations and mosaics with a variety of woodlands, grasslands and heaths. The character of these associated vegetation types reflects https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.055 Published online by Cambridge University PressU20 Pteridium aquilinum-Galium saxatile community 493 the considerable differences in regional and local climate across the wide range of country where this kind of bracken stand has become established, and their disposition frequently reflects variations in treatments subsequent to forest clearance on a range of more free-draining base-poor soils. The Pteridium-Galium community is a particularly successful replacement for woodlands on such ground and the regeneration of good quality pasture or heath presents a major problem. Much bracken-infested land has been planted up for commercial coniferous forestry, but control by the encouragement of natural woodland regeneration has been little tried. Zonations to forest vegetation are widespread throughout the range of the Pteridium-Galium community and often show a continuous gradation in floristics and structure between the bracken stands characteristic of margins and clearings and the closed stretches of woodland. Indeed, in many cases, the differences between the Pteridium-Galium vegetation and the field layers of the adjacent woodland are qualitative ones, evident mainly in the thinning of the bracken and the increased abundance of the ground cover of herbs and bryophytes as shade deepens beneath the canopy of trees. This is particularly striking in the west and north of the country, where the associated woodlands are usually of the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis or Querus-Betula-Dicranum types, the climax forest communities of more acidic but free-draining mineral soils such as brown earths and podzolised profiles. Bracken can be locally abundant beneath the canopies of oak and birch most typical of these woodlands, with the constants and preferentials of the Anthoxanthum sub-community con tinuing to be important in the field layer of grazed forests of these kinds on more mesotrophic soils, the species of the Vaccinium-Dicranum sub-community figuring pro minently in ungrazed woodlands on rockier and less fertile ground (e.g. Tittensor & Steele 1971). Particularly around the eastern Highlands, the Pteridium-Galium vegetation can also be found in association with Juni-perus-Oxalis and Pinus-Hylocomium woodlands and, again, there is a close similarity between it and the drier and less mesophytic field layers of these communities. Where tracts of woodland are unenclosed, as is usually the case through the upland fringes, the cover of trees around their margins often thins out gradually, though this is generally a reflection of decline in moribund forest fragments, rather than of expansion of young woody growth on to the surrounding bracken-infested land. There are places, however, where a thickening zone of saplings, usually birch or Sorbus aucu-paria, marks the transition from Pteridium-Galium vege tation to newly-developing woodland. And, where the community occurs on stretches of base-poor soils in lowland Britain, it is very commonly found in mosaics with young scrubby woodland, and also with overgrown heath, as on commons where traditional management has fallen into disuse (Tansley 1939, Wooldridge & Goldring 1953, Tubbs 1986, Webb 1986). In this part of the country, with its drier, warmer climate, it is the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland that is the most usual forest type found in association with the Pteridium-Galium community, once more often grading con tinuously to it. More mesotrophic brown soils, where the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland is the climax, frequently develop bracken infestation, but the vege tation is typically of the Pteridium-Rubus type. This generally has a more mesophytic flora, but it comes close to the Pteridium-Galium community in its Teuer ium sub community and, in the south-east, the two kinds of bracken stand can occur together where there are shifts from less to more fertile soils related to the disposition of different bedrocks or drift or to local eutrophication as on disturbed heaths. Mosaics with Ulex-Rubus scrub, in which bracken is a frequent and locally prominent associate, are also very common in the latter situations, as around abandoned settlements. Very often, heaths and grasslands form part of the vegetation patterns in which the Pteridium-Galium community is found, and indeed these usually predominate as associates of bracken stands in the largely deforested landscape of Britain, the proportions of the vegetation types largely reflecting differences in soils and treatments on the once-wooded ground, with some effects, too, from variations in local climate. Regional climate and contrasts in land-use history from one part of the country to another are also important because, although the Pteridium-Galium community occurs in almost every area of Britain with great uniformity in its floristics, associated grasslands and heaths show great variety in their composition in moving from east to west, south to north and with increasing altitude or exposure to maritime influence. The patterns in which this kind of bracken vegetation occurs are thus multitudinous and can only be outlined here. Beginning in the warm Continental part of the country, like Breckland, where Watt (1936) carried out his studies on pattern and process in bracken vegetation, the Pteridium-Galium community is an important ele ment in mosaics with Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland and Calluna-Festuca heath on the more acidic sandy soils, with Carex arenaria and Carex-Cladonia vege tation figuring on loose, wind-blown material. Here, the Pteridium-Galium stands are usually of the Anthoxanthum sub-community, though a mesophytic element is poorly developed and the major continuity is provided by plants such as Festuca ovina, Agrostis capillaris, Galium saxatile, Luzula campestris, Rumex acetosella and certain of the bryophytes. With the shift into the south-east, very similar patchworks of vegetation occur widely on the commons and heaths around London and in the Home Counties. The https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.055 Published online by Cambridge University Press494 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland retains its representation here on more open ground with summer-parched soils, but the dry heath is often of the Calluna-Ulex minor type (Harrison 1970). This continues to be important among the sub-shrub vegetation of drier acidic soils through central southern England where, in areas like the New Forest and remnants of the Dorset heaths, it occurs widely with Pteridium-Galium stands of all kinds. Increasingly here, though, with the higher rainfall, the calcifuge swards are of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium type or, where Agrostis curtisii has got a hold on somewhat moister humic soils, of the Agrostis type, with greater floristic continuity with the bracken vegetation. West of Poole, both these communities remain common among bracken stands in south-west England, but the Calluna-Ulex gallii heath replaces the Calluna-U. minor type (Ivimey-Cook et al. 1975) in the mosaics, remaining important with Pteridium-Galium vegetation at lower altitudes right round the coast of Wales (Rodwell 1974) and into the north Midlands. In these regions, too, and northwards around the Scottish coast, bracken stands of this kind can be found in association with Calluna-Scilla heath on the more sheltered sections of sea cliffs of base poor rocks and drift (Malloch 1971, South Gower Coast Report 1981). Through the north Midlands, the fringes of the southern Pennines and across into the North York Moors, the Pteridium-Galium community is found with Calluna-Deschampsia heath and Deschampsia grassland (Elgee 1914, Fidler et al. 1970, Daniels 1983). Here, however, down through Wales and into the fringes of the moorlands of south-west England, can be seen the major shift in the kind of landscape patterns in which Pteridium-Galium vegetation occurs, from lowland commons to upland hill slopes. Stands of the community are here often much more extensive and frequently occupy a distinct physiographic zone, between the improved and more intensive grazing of the valley floors and the unenclosed pasture, heaths and mires of the hill slopes above. Downslope, then, there is often a sudden cut-off to the bracken where assiduous management keeps Cynosurion or more mesophytic Nardo-Galion swards within the limits of enclosure free of the fern. Above, the zonations are more gradual, the bracken thinning as the soils become more shallow and rocky or where the surrounding grasslands or heaths have not yet been invaded. The most widespread calcifuge sward in these patterns is the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, the major plagioclimax pasture of free-draining base-poor soils throughout the north and west, but Nardus-Galium grassland also becomes very important where there is some impedence on the slopes around, and, as with the Pteridium-Galium community, the spread of this vegetation is a strong indication of poor pastoral treatment. Accompanying these swards, there is very often some Calluna-Vactinium heath or, in more oceanic areas, Calluna-Erica heath with Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath at higher altitudes. Species such as F. ovina, A. capillaris, Anthoxanthum, Nardus, G. saxatile, P. erecta, V. myrtillus, Calluna and the pleurocarpous mosses are a more or less constant feature of much of this vegetation, with differences in the abundance of bracken, the grasses and sub-shrubs providing most of the contrasts. Patterns of this kind, often covering huge areas, are a very familiar feature of most parts of upland Britain (Eddy et al. 1969, Ward et al. 19T2a,b, Meek 1976, Evans et al. 1977, Hill & Evans 1978). Here, too, Pteridium-Galium vegetation is frequently found closely juxtaposed with mire communities of various kinds. Even in the south-east, bracken stands of this type can occur on the more free-draining ground around Ericetum wet heath and Narthecio-Sphagnetum valley bog, but these communities are local. To the north and west, soligenous mires become very common below flushes and in water-tracks gathering run-off from the slopes, and frequently form an abrupt interruption running down through stretches of Pteridium-Galium vegetation (Ward et al. \912a,b, Lee et al. 1986, Brown & Wathern 1986). Typically, this vegetation is of the Carex-Sphagnum type, though often rush-dominated, and marking out ground which is far too wet for bracken to survive. More gradual transitions can be seen where Juncus-Galium rush-pasture is interposed between the mire and surrounding grasslands and bracken. Elsewhere in the north and west, Pteridium-Galium vegetation runs up gentle, free-draining slopes towards stretches of wet heath and blanket bog on ombrogenous peats of benches and plateaus. Again, boundaries are clearly marked here if the peats are wet and actively growing: indeed, there is often a zone of wet heath interposed between the bracken and the mire vegetation. But where the bog surface has dried out, naturally or as a result of drainage, Pteridium can encroach on to the peats occurring among mosaics of Scirpus-Erica heath and Scirpus-Eriophôrum or Calluna-Eriophorum blanket mire, with tracts of Molinia-Potentilla mire running down over slopes that remain moist but free-draining. To maintain and exert itself in all these very varied contexts, bracken must obviously be a resourceful plant. It is clearly a replacement for forest vegetation in most situations, but beyond this we know very little more about its competitive and serai relationships with the vegetation it invades than those features described by Watt from the rather unusual climatic conditions of Breckland. Watt's (1945, 1947«,Z?) account of cyclical change in bracken populations may not be universally applicable (Lee et al. 1986), although Marrs & Hicks (1986) have recently confirmed extensive natural degeneration of dense bracken to grass-heath, the Fes tuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland of this scheme, at https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.055 Published online by Cambridge University PressU20 Pteridium aquilinum-Galium saxatile community 495 Lakenheath Warren. At the same time, however, they showed that the phasic interdigitation of Pteridium-Galium vegetation with Calluna-Festuca heath, bracken and heather advancing and retreating over the ground in an overall state of balance (Watt 1955), had broken down with succession proceeding towards brackendominance. The reasons for this change, though, are not clear and may relate more to alterations in grazing, with reductions in both rabbit and sheep populations since the time of Watt's work. The prospect of waiting for natural and perhaps only temporary declines in bracken populations is a dismal one for those concerned with the urgent need to maintain the quality of pastures and heaths, and considerable attention has been given to the possibilities of reconstituting swards and sub-shrub vegetation after artificial clearance of Pteridium. Indeed, the necessity of adequate, aftercare for treated land is a vital part of judicious control (Robinson 1986, Soper 1986, Horsnail 1986), and rarely does the death of the fern reveal the kind of lush grazing that some seem to think lies beneath their bracken. Immediate developments depend on the kind of herbicide treatment and on the plants initially present in the bracken understorey or with seed sources near at hand, recolonisation sometimes being strongly related to vegetative survivors (Sparke 1982, Sparke & Williams 1986), in other cases to soil seed stores or nearby seed-parents (Lowday 1986). Asulam is more specific for bracken than is, for example, glyphosate, although even with the former, early stages in revegetation may be dominated by plants like Digitalis, Cir sium spp., Urtica or Rumex acetosella, able to take rapid advantage of newly-cleared ground, and wherever particular elements of the understorey are important to conserve it is necessary to resort to a laborious method of directed application such as a rope-wick technique (Lowman 1985). Subsequent developments in swards are partly dependent on the extent of bracken regrowth and partly on the style of grazing: where Pteridium does not reassert itself continuance of the same pattern of grazing has been shown to favour predominance of grasses over dicotyledons, although shifts in their pro portions, such as the demise of Agrostis spp. with glyphosate spraying, or the local abundance of Holcus mollis, can persist long (Sparke & Williams 1986). Surface treatments, such as the raking off, burning or incorporation of the bracken litter, may also have an effect, because some species are unable to grow over a thick blanket of decaying fronds, while others are stimulated to germinate by disturbance of stored seed (Cadbury 1976, Sparke 1982, Sparke & Williams 1986). More vigorous aftercare, with burning of litter, application of lime and phosphate and re-seeding, can result in the establishment of a good quality artificial sward (Sparke & Williams 1986).Removal of litter after spraying has also been shown to be beneficial for the re-establishment of Calluna on bracken-infested lowland heaths, although in experiments in Breckland, invasion of Betula pendula from buried seed and nearby trees was rapid too, and seen as a possible threat to the regeneration of sub-shrub vegetation (Lowday 1986). The possibilities of controlling bracken itself by stim ulating renewed succession to forest have not escaped notice. Indeed, the Pteridium-Galium community fre quently occupies soils which remain above average in their potential for tree growth, planting not usually necessitating ploughing or draining, although of course it is often necessary to hold back the shading or swamping fronds by cutting or herbicide treatment until the saplings are tall and robust enough to grow clear (Helliwell 1986). Many stands of this kind of vegetation thus persist within and around tracts of commercial forests, invariably coniferous, through the upland fringes, grading into the field layers wherever the shade is not too dense. Natural regeneration among bracken may also be more likely than at first sight (Watt 1976). It was one of the surprises of the study of Marrs & Hicks (1986) that, at Lakenheath, Pinus sylvestris had invaded and grown to maturity since 1946 not only among sparse Pteridium-Galium vegetation, but also where the cover was dense, the major limit on pine spread apparently being seed dispersal. Such results will perhaps help us regain a view of bracken as originally a pioneer plant, serai to forest, and they hold out one hope of natural control (Page 1986). Distribution "
"u21","Zonation and succession The Cryptogramma-Deschampsia community is typi cally found with lithophyte vegetation and heaths in the early stages of succession on talus and boulders of hard, acidic rocks. The progression of the sere can be set back in any stage by shifting of the detritus but, even where it advances far, the influence of grazing or burning generally prevents the establishment of forest, deflecting the succession to plagioclimax pasture or heath, which communities now usually occupy the bulk of the stabilised slopes around stands of the community. Epilithic lichen assemblages, generally grouped in the Leprarion chlorinae or Lecideion tumidae alliances according to whether they comprise shade or sun species (James et al. 1977), are often the first colonisers of the surfaces of the kinds of rocks among which the Cryptogramma-Deschampsia community eventually develops, https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.056 Published online by Cambridge University PressU21 Cryptogramma crispa-Deschampsia flexuosa community 501 and they can persist in mosaics with this vegetation over any remaining exposed rocks. Then, there are rocksurface bryophytes, notably Andreaea rupestris and Racomitrium fasciculare, which also make an early appearance though these do not seem to provide a congenial surface for subsequent invaders and cannot really be considered to play an active part in succession. They may, however, persist long. Other mosses, such as Racomitrium heterostichum and Dicranella heteromalla, may play a subsidiary role in helping to disintegrate mineral material but it is only with the appearance of the pioneers of sheltered crevices, notably Diplophyllum, that the progression to the Cryptogramma-Deschampsia community can be really seen as initiated. Developments beyond the establishment of the community depend first on the stability of the substrate and, indeed, in many cases, the sere is repeatedly set back by slipping of the talus or tumbling of boulders on to the vegetation. But where this does not happen, the natural successor to the Cryptogramma-Deschampsia community is probably some kind of heath. Calluna, E. cinerea and V. myrtillus can all invade stabilised patches of this vegetation and, where competition from these and vigorously growing grasses becomes severe, Cryptogramma suffers and eventually dies out. Towards lower altitudes and particularly in more oceanic regions, the Calluna-Erica heath can succeed the fern vegetation with the Calluna-Vaccinium heath favouring the cooler, more humid environment of higher altitudes and shaded aspects, the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath becoming important towards the uppermost limit of this community’s range. Where such vegetation types develop among existing Cryptogramma-Deschampsia stands, species such as D. flexuosa, F. ovina, Anthoxanthum, Agrostis spp., Nardus and Galium saxatile all provide a strong floristic continuity, but the sub-shrubs become dominant and among them there is often an increase in bulky pleurocarpous mosses or lichens at the expense of the smaller acrocarps represented among the fern patches. Within the forest zone, the natural climax of such a succession is the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland and young saplings of the characteristic tree species of this community, Betula pubescens and Sorbus aucuparia in particular, with Quercus petraea occurring more rarely, can sometimes be found invading stable stretches of scree. This is a rare phenomenon, though, partly because of the scarcity of seed-parents over many upland slopes, but also because of the virtually ubiquitous occurrence of grazing. Subsequent succession beyond the Cryptogramma-Deschampsia community, then, is likely to be deflected to swards like the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, where the fine-leaved grass associates of the fern beds become the dominant element in the vegetation. Or, where burning also plays some part in the land management, Cö//wwö-dominated stands of the heaths may be more or less permanently maintained and mosaics of such grassland and heaths often make up much of the closed vegetation around open screes where the Cryptogramma-Deschampsia community persists. A further important element in such patterns is Pteridium-Galium vegetation, a very widespread community now where colluvial soils have been cleared of forest through the upland fringes, and one which is able to invade up screes where these are reasonably stable, overwhelming such stands of Cryptogramma-Deschampsia vegetation as occur there. Distribution "
"u3","Zonation and succession The Agrostis grassland is a treatment-derived replacement for various heath communities that characteristically occur in zonations of sub-shrub and mire vege tation developed in relation to drainage impedence, often with bracken, sometimes with other grasslands, scrub and woodland reflecting different responses to particular histories of burning, grazing and disturbance. Generally, at lower altitudes, it is found as a local, and often temporary, element on the sequences of communities around valley mires. On higher ground, it can also form part of the fringing zone of grasslands and heaths around the blanket bog of the summits, and here it may become a more permanent component of upland pasture. The particular communities involved in the lowland sequence vary according to the locality. In the New Forest, where the classic pattern of valley-mire vege tation types described by Rose (1953) can still be widely seen around the elongated hollows eroded into the cover of sands and gravel, the Agrostis grassland is usually found as a replacement for stretches of the Ulex minor-Agrostis heath, sandwiched between the Calluna-U. minor heath of sharply-draining podzols and the Erice-tum tetralicis on seasonally-waterlogged soils. In the former direction, A. curtisii can extend some little way if there is local impedence in profiles with much clay below or an iron pan; in the latter, it is quickly extinguished, except where slight soligenous influence ameliorates the lack of aeration, though then Molinia can out-compete it. Full sequences, in which the zonation continues downslope into the Narthecio-Sphagnetum valley bog, occur on Cranesmoor, Denny, Holmsley and Wilverley bogs (Newbould 1960, Ratcliffe 1977, Tubbs 1986), but extensive patchworks of the heaths with Agrostis grassland are to be seen over the terraces and undulating lower ground of the southern part of the forest (Lambert & Manners 1964, Fisher 1975 a,Z?), with deposits of Brick Earth providing a particularly congenial substrate for the grass to get a firm hold (Tubbs 1986). Moving westwards, the New Forest pattern is repeated in its essential features, though on not nearly so extensive a scale, on the Hartland-Arne and Studland-Godlingston heaths, the largest remnants of the once extensive continuation of heathland vegetation around Poole (N. W. Moore 1962, Webb 1986). Then, with the move on to the next most important area of this kind of vegetation, on the Devonsire Pebble-Bed commons, the Ulex minor-Agrostis heath is replaced by the Ulex gallii-Agrostis heath as the usual progenitor of the Agrostis grassland, with the Calluna-U. gallii heath appearing as the characteristic dry sub-shrub community in the sequence. Aylesbeare Common has some good zonations of this kind (Ivimey-Cook et al. 1975), with the interesting complication of soligenous Schoenus-Narth-ecium mire along soakways, and Cirsio-Molinietum and Molinia-Potentilla mire over the lightly-flushed slopes around. In these kinds of system, the base-enrichment is usually very slight and dependent on sub-surface drainage from limy strata. On The Lizard, however, the Agrostis grassland can be found as a replacement for the U. gallii-Agrostis heath in close juxtaposition with vege tation whose character is determined by the serpentine and gabbro which give rise to soils that are lime-poor but base-rich. Here, the community and its heath progenitor mark out patches of loess and Crousa Gravels that mask the influence of the underlying bedrocks. Over the deeper deposits, E. vagans cannot grow but, where the drift cover thins, there can be some striking vegetation transitional to the E. vagans-Schoenus heath of the gleyed profiles developed from the igneous parent materials (Coombe & Frost 1956 a, Hopkins 1983). A.curtisii can also gain a locally dominant hold in loess-contaminated soils transitional to the free-draining brown earths which, around the cliff-top margins of The Lizard, have the other endemic sub-shrub community of the area, the E. vagans-U. europaeus heath (Hopkins 1983). Moving to the wetter and cooler climate of the high ground in the South-West Peninsula, the U. gallii-Agrostis heath continues a strong representation around the fringes of Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor and Exmoor and, together with derived stretches of Agrostis grassland, it can be found around the topogenous hollows and their associated water-tracks that drain radially from the summits. Here, though, there tends to be a shift in the whole character of the vegetation towards the sub montane with some kind of Scirpus-Erica wet heath replacing the Ericetum tetralicis on the wetter ground or rush-dominated Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire along soakways. Then, towards drier ground, it is bilberry https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.038 Published online by Cambridge University Press328 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities rather than gorse which often provides the most obvious floristic continuity from the Agrostis grassland to the dry sub-shrub vegetation, which is here often represented by the Calluna-Vaccinium heath occurring on brown podzolic soils and rankers, frequently on steep rocky slopes. Also here, though, the Agrostis grassland and the U. gallii-Agrostis heath can be seen as part of the larger-scale zonation which runs, in crudely concentric fashion, around the blocks of higher ground. Above, on intergrade stagnopodzols and stagnohumic gleys developed over the edge of the summit plateaus, there is a transition to Scirpus-Erica wet heath and then, over the deeper ombrogenous peat, to Scirpus-Eriophorum blanket mire. This kind of pattern is best developed over Dartmoor and well illustrated in the map and descriptions of Ward et al (1972zz), though less extensive and clear zonations can also be seen over the other major upland areas of the south-west. The clarity of definition of the Agrostis grassland among the heaths which immediately give rise to it and the neighbouring sub-shrub communities is largely a function of the treatment the vegetation has received. The impact of a recent burn or the effect of a sharp grazing boundary can be very clear, with an abrupt switch in dominance from the grass to the particular assemblage of sub-shrubs, but often the zonations are much less well defined, where recovery from burning is well advanced or where grazing is light or sporadic. In previous accounts, 'grass-heath' categories have sometimes been devised to cater for difficult intermediates or fine mosaics (Ward et al-. 1912a, Tubbs 1986) and, in this scheme, the U. minor-Agrostis, U. gallii-Agrostis and E. vagans-Ulex heaths all have sub-communities in which A. curtisii is especially abundant in relation to the woody plants: it should always be remembered that variation among these elements is virtually continuous. Then, there are other developments which can supervene as a result of the perturbations produced by different treatments and these can complicate the basic patterns described above. In the first place, on soils which are a little moister than usual, but well aerated, a situation often associated with some slight sub-surface through-put in heaths on sloping ground, Molinia often has a better start in regeneration than has A. curtisii. Although this grass is much more palatable than the bent, indeed it often provides the best early bite of all in burned heaths, it too can quickly become abundant after fires. Stands in which the grasses are co-dominant can still be included here but, where Molinia is clearly in the ascendancy, the vegetation is best placed in the Anthoxanthum sub-community of the Molinia-Potentilla mire. This can frequently be found with stands of the Agrostis grassland and many of the herbaceous associates are the same, the boundary between the communities being often dependent on the relative abundance of the two grasses. Nardus stricta, on the other hand, which is so abundant in poor-quality grazings over the ill-drained upland areas through Wales and northern Britain, does not seem to present much challenge to A. curtisii in some parts of the south-west, notably Dartmoor, even on the peaty intergrades. It has been suggested that this is because the plant is kept in check by a diversity of grazing stock, particularly by the ponies which bite the heart out of the tufts (Havinden & Wilkinson 1970, Ward et al. 1912a). A second development can be seen where the soils are well drained but somewhat more base-rich than is usual where A. curtisii flourishes. Then, after burning or under the influence of long, hard grazing alone, grasses such as Festuca ovina, Agrostis capillaris and Anthoxanthum can become co-dominant in a Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland. Sometimes, such swards develop on distinct patches of brown earth soils, perhaps maintained by flushing, as over the highest northern terraces of the New Forest, or where the stretches of heath abut on to stream sides, woodland margins, roadside verges or the edges of settlements where pH can remain low but where there is some measure of enrichment from flooding, leaf fall and dunging. A. curtisii sometimes persists in such grasslands but only in small amounts and the distinction between the communities is often clear, particularly where more mesophytic grasses and dicotyledons get a hold. In the New Forest, this kind of vegetation makes up the best grazing on the drier 'lawns', where liming has been used in some places to enhance the quality of the herbage further, with the development of particularly rich Lolio-Cynosuretum and Lolio-Plantaginetum grasslands (Tubbs 1986). Although of highly artificial origin, these vegetation types form a very interesting local series grading continuously into Agrostis grassland. Around the upland fringes, such diversity is uncommon but, on Dartmoor, the Agrostis grassland occurs widely in mosaics with Festuca-Agrostis-Galium swards on brown podzolic soils and it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish the two (Tansley 1939, Ward et al. 1912a). Where more mesotrophic brown earths with these grasslands have had some modest disturbance, Ulex europaeus often invades and patches of Ulex-Rubus scrub, developing where grazing is light, often mark out old (sometimes very old) field boundaries and settlements among stretches of Agrostis grassland. On deeper soils with free drainage, though, a more likely development after fires or where sheep alone are grazed, is for bracken to spread. A. curtisii can persist under a quite dense cover of the fronds (Ivimey-Cook 1959) but, where invasion is very vigorous, as over stoneless colluvial soils, the Pteridium-Galium community becomes established. Cutting can push back the succession and, combined with grazing, particularly if heavier-tramphttps://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.038 Published online by Cambridge University PressU3 Agrostis curtisii grassland 329 ling cattle and ponies are used, re-establish Agrostis grassland (Tubbs 1986). Distribution "
"u4","Zonation and succession Through the open grazings of the sub-montane west and north of Britain, the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland can be found with a great variety of other grasslands, heaths and mires, in diverse patchworks that reflect differences in regional climate across its wide range, and variations in soils and treatments over particular stretches of hills. Grazing is of prime importance in preventing the regression of the community to woody vegetation and, though it is possible that towards its very highest limits some stands would revert to climax heath, most would be succeeded by scrub and woodland if treatment ceased. In altitudinal sequences, then, this is a community of the forest zone and sub-alpine transition, limited above by the harsh climate and now curtailed below by enclosure and improvement. The Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland makes its maximum contribution to upland rough grazings on the well-drained, acidic soils characteristic of steeper slopes underlain by lime-poor substrates, and some of the commonest zonations in which it is seen are related to shifts from these favoured geological, topographic and edaphic conditions, particularly as they affect the moisture regime, base-status and trophic state of the soils. For example, the community often extends on to shal low rankers, provided these are not disposed among boulders or on ledges inaccessible to grazing stock, where shrubs and trees can invade, but where there is any tendency for such soils to become parched in dry weather, the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland is usually replaced by more fragmentary swards of the Thero-Airion type. Such transitions are best seen over small, fractured rock outcrops around the drier southern and eastern fringes of the uplands (Jarvis 1974, Sinker et al. 1985, Hughes & Huntley 1986), though they persist locally in wetter regions on warmer, south-facing slopes (Birse 1980), and they often involve a switch to the Festuca-Agrostis-Rumex grassland. In such situations, the thinning and increased droughtiness of the soil cover is marked by a change to a more open and tussocky turf, lacking such species as Anthoxanthum, Potentilla erecta, Luzula campestris and Viola riviniana, together with the bulky pleurocarpous mosses, but gaining plants like Rumex acetosella, Air a praecox, Poa annua and other ephemerals, Sedum anglicum and acro carpous mosses. Much more extensive and important, though, are those patterns related to increased moisture of the soil, which can be a function of higher precipitation and runoff, flushing or drainage impedence. Sometimes the changes are fairly subtle, relating to a slight lessening of slope and accumulation of downwashed colluvial material, when the deeper and better integrated profiles can be marked just by a shift from Typical Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland to the more mesophytic Hol cus-Trifolium sub-community. A similar change, sometimes amounting to little more than a rise in the fre quency of H. lanatus, T. repens, Achillea millefolium and Cerastium fontanum, can accompany the move from arenaceous parent materials to more argillaceous ones, quite a slight increase of clay in the profile being sufficient to slow down leaching, raise the base-status a little and improve the texture. Such patterns can be seen where the sandstones are replaced by shales in sequences of Devonian, Silurian and Carboniferous rocks such as underlie much of south-west England, Wales and the Southern Uplands, the change in geology often being matched by a shift from steeper and craggier slopes to more gentle ground. Or, where slopes lessen, there can be smears of clayey drift which mask the controlling influence of pervious sandstones. In all these cases, the move from shedding towards receiving drainage helps confirm the lithological influence of the parent materials. Very commonly, however, the impedence of run-off in situations like this is such as to effect a more marked floristic change. Characteristically, over the lower ground through the uplands, high rainfall and water shed from surrounding hills induces surface-water gley ing over impermeable substrates on gentle slopes, brown earths or podzolised profiles being replaced by stagno-gleys or where, in impeded hollows, there is some shallow fluctuation of the water-table, by ground-water gleys. Then, the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland typically gives way to the Juncus-Galium mire, physiog-nomically a rush-pasture, dominated by clumps of J. acutiflorus or J. effusus, and with such Molinietalia associates as Galium palustre, Cirsium palustre, Lotus uliginosus, Ranunculusflammula and Angelica sylvestris. Sometimes, where the underlying edaphic differences are sharp, the floristic junctions are correspondingly abrupt, but where it is drift that is the primary control on drainage, then the changes are much more gradual. Boundaries can be further blurred where, as is usually the case, stock have access, when an ill-defined mosaic of vegetation types is produced among the clumps of unpalatable rushes. Receiving most of the attention of the grazing stock, the swards between get a concentration of dung and then a Cynosurion element can become prominent in the transition, with the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community surrounding the clumps of rush-pasture and giving way on steeper slopes to Typical Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland. There can be a marked drift of more mesophytic plants in such situa-https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.039 Published online by Cambridge University Press342 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities tions, with species like Festuca rubra, H. lanatus and T. repens well represented throughout. Very often, too, patchworks of this kind have been further improved by draining of the wetter ground, with the consequent expansion of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, the application of artificials like basic slag helping to maintain higher fertility and favouring the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community. Much pasture upgraded in this way has been taken in towards the limits of enclosure and sometimes given more assiduous improvement, but neg lect can allow quite rapid reversion to a rush-pasture mosaic where the drains become blocked, and the toing and froing of land around the fringes of the uplands between these vegetation types is often a reflection of the state of the agricultural economy. Mixtures of the communities figure prominently in the pastures des cribed from the Cheviots by King (1962; see also King & Nicholson 1964) and very extensive tracts occur over the undulating foothills of central Wales and the Southern Uplands. Gleyed mineral soils of the kinds which support these transitions from the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland to the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture can readily accumulate a humose topsoil in the wetter parts of the country and the resultant humic gleys and stagnohumic gleys are often intergrades to acid peats proper which have built up over benches and plateaus and in waterlogged hollows through western and northern Britain. In some such situations, the zonations described above form just part of extensive vegetation sequences which run on into Ericion wet heath and Erico-Sphagnion blanket mire on thickening ombrogenous peat that has developed over increasingly gentle slopes, running back from scarps to shelving dips, up from steep slopes on to high-altitude plateaus or down to low-level benches. In other cases, the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture forms a transition zone on the gleyed surrounds to water-tracks and flushes running through Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, a common feature where steeper hill slopes channel run off into juvenile streams or where impermeable rocks or drift bring soil waters to the surface within stretches of open pasture. Then, the Juncus-Galium vegetation usually gives way in turn to a strip of rush-dominated Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire over the irrigated peaty soil but grazing and trampling can fret the boundaries of these zonations and maintain patches of grassy sward among clumps of rushes in close juxtaposition with the Sphagnum carpet of the flushed ground. A frequent complication of these kinds of soil-related patterns where the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland occurs among better-aerated peaty profiles at lower altitudes in the western part of its range is the spread of Molinia. In contrast to the Juncus-Galium rush-pasture, the Molinia-Potentilla mire, which contains most of the A/b/zmö-dominated swards in this part of the country, is characteristically associated with areas of quickening drainage through peaty mineral soils and true peats, and it can often be seen among stretches of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland towards the western seaboard of Bri tain, around the heads and sides of moorland streams and fringing soligenous and basin mires (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Ratcliffe & Hattey 1982). In such edaphic and climatic conditions, Molina can be very vigorous, its dominance marking out the boundary between one vegetation type and the other quite clearly, but where the Molinia-Potentilla mire has been burned and grazed, a common practice, continuing predation by stock can maintain fairly short and diverse swards over the peatier soils, and the floristic continuity is then considerable. The Anthoxanthum sub-community of the Molinia-Potentilla mire, for example, has frequent Anthoxanthum, Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra, Holcus lanatus and Potentilla erecta, and occurs very extensively with Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland in Wales and southwest Scotland. Similar vegetation can also be found over shallow ombrogenous peats where wet heath has been transformed into grassy Molinia mire by burning and grazing. In the cool and wet conditions at higher altitudes, the spread of Nardus presents a different complication to the picture. This grass is of varying frequency through the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland and its abundance is always strongly influenced by the treatments which the swards have received. But edaphically, it competes least well on the well-drained moder and mull soils characteristic of the Typical and Holcus-Trifolium sub-communities, rather better on some of the cold humic gleys that, in the western Highlands, can carry the Luzula-Rhytidiadelphus sub-community, and best of all on profiles which combine a humose topsoil with a strongly-leached and oligotrophic mineral base, often gleyed (e.g. Pearsall 1968). In some of the transitions already mentioned, Nardus can increase its cover where there is a tendency for such soils to develop, so that a zone of Nardus-Galium grassland becomes interposed in the sequences: this can happen over much-trampled transitions between the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland and Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire towards higher alti tudes, where the community gives way to ill-drained stretches of Molinia-Potentilla mire, and where, over redistributed peat washed down from above, there is a zonation to run-down wet heath and blanket mire (e.g. Smith 1918). Very frequently, too, Nardus spreads within the Vaccinium-Deschampsia sub-community where it extends on to humic stagnopodzols, a common feature on drift-smeared slopes at higher altitudes, and then there can be a patchy mosaic of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium and Nardus-Galium grasslands. In such situations, the latter community is often readily picked out in winter by the abundant bleached herbage of the mat https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.039 Published online by Cambridge University PressU4 Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland 343 grass but the two vegetation types have many associates in common: Festuca ovina, Agrostis capillaris, Des champsia flexuosa, Potentilla erecta, Galium saxatile, Vaccinium myrtillus and pleurocarpous mosses all provide strong continuity through the swards. It has been suggested (Heddle & Ogg 1936, Fenton 1937, Harris 1939) that the spread of Nardus into the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland in situations such as these is a consequence of the historical switch from cattle to sheep as the major grazing stock and, more recently, from wethers to the more selective breeding ewes (Roberts 1959, Grant et al. 1985). Where Nardus is becoming entrenched, it may thus now require densities of sheep to control it which are unacceptably high for the continued health of the better-quality Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland (Nicholson et al. 1970), such that the mat grass continues its advance or becomes firmly entrenched in sharply-defined mosaics. In all of the zonations described so far, there is generally a marked poverty of bases in all the soils, but different kinds of pattern can be seen where this situation is relieved, either by some change in parent materials or by irrigation of the profiles by lime-rich waters. Through most of its range, the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland is replaced in such circumstances by the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, a community with which it shares many catholic and mildly calcifuge herbs, but where there is fairly consistent enrichment with plants such as Thymus praecox, Carex panicea, C. pulicaris, Selaginella selaginoides and calcicolous bryophytes. The two vegetation types come closest over drier soils, as where there is a change from brown earths of low base-status to those with a higher pH and calcium content where, say, limy partings occur among base deficient shales or a drift cover thins over native calcareous rocks: then, the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland is usually represented by the Trifolium-Luzula sub community which can grade almost imperceptibly into Typical Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland or the Hol cus-Trifolium sub-community. More striking patterns are to be seen around base-rich flushes where, within the space of a few metres, there can be a transition from Typical Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland over the unirrigated sopes, through the Carex sub-community of the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland to a Caricion davallianae mire on a calcareous gley, with perhaps a Cratoneurion spring at its head. At moderate altitudes through the northern part of the range of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, the small-sedge mire vege tation in such zonations is usually of the Pinguiculo-Caricetum type, with the Carici-Saxifragetum replacing it in stony flushes over higher ground. At higher alti tudes, too, over moderately base-rich mulls through the Scottish Highlands, the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath can figure in such sequences. Alchemilla alpina and T. praecox are good indicators of transitions to this kind of vegetation with, in moister situations, basiphilous small sedges but, again, there can be con siderable floristic continuity through the swards. With the move southwards into the Craven district, it is the Sesleria-Galium grassland that constitutes the more calcicolous element in grassland patchworks of this type, marking out extensive stretches of calcareous lithomorphic soils, with the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland limited to places where surface leaching of native profiles is more pronounced or where the influence of the underlying bedrock is masked by light-textured drift. A comparable situation pertains in the Derbyshire Dales, towards the south-eastern limit of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, although here the climate is sufficiently warm and dry for the Festuca-Avenula grassland to occupy the rendzina soils on the steeper valley sides, with the distinctive Lathyrus-Stachys sub-community of the more calcifuge grassland marking out the loess-contaminated soils on the brow tops (Balme 1953, Pigott 1962, Grime 1963«,/?). More natural sequences here can run on into the Vaccinium-Deschampsia sub-community with D. flexuosa showing a tendency to invade and acidify the shallower and less base-poor soils and consequently modifying the floristics and structure of the Lathyrus-Stachys sub-community (Grime 1963&, Pigott 1970«) but, in many places, the deeper soils of the plateau have been improved so that, beyond a field boundary, there is often a sharp change to the Holcus-Trifolium sub-community or a Cynosurion sward. In all these patterns, grazing is usually the major factor in preventing the reversion of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland and the other plagioclimax swards with which it occurs to the different kinds of forest from which they were, in the main, originally derived. The effects of a reduction in grazing pressure are widely seen among tracts of the community where the ground becomes naturally less accessible to the stock, as where there are tumbles of blocky talus over the slopes, or where crags and ravines interrupt the land scape, although in such places the change in topography often affects soil development and climate, so that the transitions to lush herbaceous or woody vegetation seen there are usually of complex origin. More obviously serai are those situations where stock have been temporarily or permanently withdrawn from the open pastures, reflecting the fate of local farming enterprises or the vicissitudes of the agricultural economy as a whole, with a neglect of the grazings or enclosure for alternative purposes such as forestry or water resource management. In fact, the continuing high value of the betterquality elements among our rough pastures, like the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, means that such opportunities for succession are fairly scarce. Where https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.039 Published online by Cambridge University Press344 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities they do occur, the first invaders are often birch, usually Betula pubescens but with B. pendula locally prominent in some places, as through parts of east-central Scot land, and Sorbus aucuparia, with pines frequently seed ing in from plantations, and oaks, generally Quercus petraea but locally Q. robur, sometimes coming in later (Pearsall & Pennington 1973). On the more base-poor and rocky soils supporting the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, such species would probably eventually come to dominate in the kind of vegetation we see in the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland, the field layer of which can present virtually identical mixtures of plants to those found here in the Vaccinium-Deschampsia sub community and some of the more unremittingly calcifuge Typical stands. Over less impoverished soils on to which the grassland extends, where Corylus avellana or even Crataegus monogyna can sometimes be found among the early colonisers after withdrawal of grazing, the serai trend is probably towards the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland, a forest type whose herbaceous ele ment is akin to the more mesophytic Festuca-Agrostis-Galium swards, such as are included in the Typical, Holcus-Trifolium and Luzula-Rhytidiadelphus sub communities. Both these woodland communities are widespread through the northern and western sub montane zone of Britain and can often be seen in close association with the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, though not commonly in active successional development from it. More commonly, the woodlands occur as an enclosed element in the landscape towards the lower altitudinal limits of the grassland or extend up through it in fragmentary fashion in inaccessible ravines. Or, they are open to the stock, offering valuable sheltered grazing in hard weather and often being in the later stages of conversion back to pasture after a period of enclosure for coppicing, rarely practised now: such woodlands, with their characteristically grassy field layers, are often essentially Festuca-Agrostis-Galium swards with a canopy of over-mature trees. Even where there are reductions in grazing of Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, however, the progression to woodland is by no means assured. In the first place, seed parents of some important potential invaders, like the oaks, are very scarce through much of the sub-montane zone. Others, like the birches and pines, whose seed is numerous and widely dispersed by the wind, need an open well-lit turf for establishment, and suitable con ditions can be very short-lived before the development of a rank tussocky sward precludes further establishment. Then, there is the possibility of expansion of sub shrubs previously held in check but readily able to form a heathy cover in which trees can get a hold only with difficulty. Calluna and V. myrtillus can both be found with varying degrees of frequency as sparse sprigs in the sward and can become important dominants in heaths developed from Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland with, less commonly, Ulex minor, U. gallii, Erica cinerea and Empetrum nigrum ssp. nigrum playing a part in various parts of the range. Through the sub-montane zone, the community is found very commonly in mosaics with various kinds of heath, the balance between burning and grazing playing a controlling role in determining their proportions as plagioclimax replacements for forest and the direction of successional shifts between them. The Calluna-Ulex minor heath in the New Forest and around Poole Harbour towards the south-eastern climatic limit of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, the Calluna-Ulexgallii heath at lower altitudes through the south-west of England and Wales, the Calluna-Erica cinerea heath in the western parts of Scotland, the Calluna-Scilla heath around the maritime fringe, the Calluna-Vaccinium heath in the less oceanic parts of the sub-montane zone and the Calluna-Deschampsia heath through the polluted southern Pen-nines -all these can occur in patchworks with or gradations to the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland and some of them have distinct sub-communities representing spatial or serai transitions to it. Towards its highest altitudinal limits, the community can also be found with the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath and it is possible that, just beyond the forest zone, this is an original precursor to high-level stands. Another shrub which commonly features in Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland towards lower altitudes is Ulex europaeus and transitions to patches of Ulex-Rubus scrub often mark out the sites of old settlements or disturbed boundary banks in tracts of the pasture, pathways through it or enclosures which have passed in and out of intensive use for grazing. The other highly significant development which can supervene in the regression of neglected Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland is the spread of Pteridium aquilinum. Typically, through the sub-montane zone, this fern grows most vigorously on colluvial soils, over which it is abundant in the two kinds of woodland from which the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland has commonly deve loped. Many of the slope-foot stands of dense Pteri-dium-Galium vegetation to be seen today throughout the unenclosed rough grazings of the uplands no doubt derive directly from the field layers of cleared forest, but bracken has increased its extent very considerably through what were once open pastures. Changes in treatment are certainly partly to blame for this: bracken is no longer cut as it once was for bedding, and the shift towards grazing almost exclusively with sheep means that the advancing fronts of fronds no longer get the heavy trampling that cattle used to give them. Transitions between the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland and the Pteridium-Galium vegetation can be very gra dual, and species such as Potentilla erecta, Galium https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.039 Published online by Cambridge University PressU4 Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland 345 saxatile and Dicranum scoparium can run on sparsely under quite dense covers of fronds, but much pasture with bracken is virtually useless once the annual cover of shoots is well grown and the re-establishment of trees where grazing is abandoned completely is well nigh impossible. Distribution "
"u5","Zonation and succession The Nardus-Galium grassland occurs widely through the uplands of northern and western Britain in zonations and mosaics with a variety of other grasslands, heaths and mires, where the major influences on the vegetation patterns are soil differences and treatments. Regional climatic variations across the range of the community affect the particular components of these patchworks and local climatic differences mediate transitions to windswept moss-heath and snow-beds. In most situations, however, the Nardus-Galium grassland is an an thropogenic vegetation type, derived by the burning and grazing of cleared land in the forest zone. Although relaxation of pasturing might allow a ready reversion to heath in many places, the run-down of ground long occupied by the community may hinder any succession to forest at lower altitudes.Some of the clearest edaphically-related zonations involving the Nardus-Galium grassland can be seen where the moist, peaty soils that it favours occur as intergrades between more sharply draining podzols and rankers on steeper, shedding slopes and thicker peats kept moist by heavy rainfall or locally impeded drainage over flatter ground. Quite commonly, such patterns find clear expression in an altitudinal banding with a zone of Nardus-Galium grassland occupying the gentler ground on transitions between the steeper hillsides below and the summit plateaus above, but more complex patterns can be seen over stepped topography or more broken slopes. The zonation over the drier podzols is very often to the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland and, over graded transitions on higher hills, the Vaccinium-Deschampsia sub-community of that vegetation, which has occasional Nardus, can pass almost imperceptibly into Species-poor Nardus-Galium grassland. In other cases, sharper topographical changes from slope to plateau, or scarp to dip, can show a more abrupt zonation of these vegetation types: these sometimes mark geological shifts from resistant pervious bedrocks to softer, impervious ones, as over grit/shale alternations, while elsewhere the deposition of heavy drift sharpens up drainage differences by enhancing impedence over gentler slopes. Then, the sudden change in the abundance of Nardus may provide a much better indication of the boundaries between the communities, the belts and patches of the Nardus-Galium grassland showing up especially clearly in winter, although there is still often considerable qualitative continuity among the associates in the swards. Patterns of these kinds are very widespread through the British uplands, and well illus trated in the account of the Moffat Hills (Smith 1918) and, in more fragmentary fashion, in maps of the Carneddau (Ratcliffe 1959a) and Cader Idris (Edgell 1969). They have been clearly described too from the southern Pennines, although here the swards of the steeper, better-drained ground tend to be of the Des champsia flexuosa type (Adamson 1918), while in the warm oceanic south-west of England such Nardus-Galium grassland as does occur is often found in association with the Agrostis curtisii grassland (e.g. Ward et al. 1972a). In the other direction in edaphic transitions of this kind, the Nardus-Galium grassland often passes to some kind of bog or related vegetation on ombrogenous peat that has accumulated over summit plateaus or high-level terraces. Ultimately, it is blanket mire that usually terminates such sequences, with the Calluna-Eriophorum bog occurring over the flatter summits of the Grampians, the higher ground in the Southern Uplands and down the Pennines, the more oceanic Scirpus-Eriophorum bog being found in association with the community in more westerly parts of Scotland, in https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.040 Published online by Cambridge University PressU5 Nardus stricta-Galium saxatile grassland 359 Wales and the south-west of England. And sometimes the Nardus-Galium grassland can give way abruptly to such vegetation, with little floristic continuity, where the peat mantle becomes suddenly thicker. Often, however, there is an intervening zone with a more gentle transition between the extremes, either over the gradually thickening humose topsoil that eventually passes to deep intact peat, or over redistributed peat eroded from the blanket bog fringe above and washed down over the slopes, this latter a widespread and extensive feature of many upland areas now. In such zonations, the Agrostis-Polytrichum sub-community is often the commonest form of Nardus-Galium grassland and this can grade to Ericion wet heath over thicker peats, the Juncus-Dicranum sub-community of the Ericetum tetralicis figuring widely in these patterns in the east-central Highlands, the Vaccinium sub-community of the more oceanic Scirpus-Erica wet heath being commoner through the Southern Uplands, Wales and the South-West Peninsula. Moving into such vegetation, the grass cover usually becomes patchy, with Scirpus cespitosus and sub-shrubs such as V. myrtillus, Calluna, Empetrum nigrum and Erica tetralix increasing in abundance, and Sphagna like 5. capillifolium, S. compactum, S. subnitens and S. tenellum appearing. In other cases, Dicranum scoparium, Racomtrium lanuginosum, pleurocarpous mosses and various larger lichens can become prominent in these transitions and, over exposed fringes of eroding blanket mire around the western seaboard of Scotland, the Racomitrium sub-community of the Nar dus-Galium grassland can play a locally important part in gradations to wet heath (Ratcliffe 1977). Another very common plant over these intermediate zones of wet but fairly thin peat is Juncus squarrosus, which occurs widely in all proportions with Nardus, either in intimate mix tures or in complicated patchy mosaics with one or the other species dominant. In this scheme, a distinct Jun cus-Festuca grassland subsumes most of the vegetation of this kind in which J. squarrosus is clearly the more abundant plant (cf. Ratcliffe 1959zz, Birks 1973, Birse & Robertson 1976, Birse 1980), but gradations between this and Nardus-Galium grassland, particularly the Agrostis-Poly trichum and Carex-Viola sub-communities, can be complex and virtually continuous (Ratcliffe 1959a, Welch 1967). The Nardus-Galium grassland can also be found as a transitional community where free-draining soils give way to gleys maintained by irrigation from springs or seepage lines, and indeed in regions with very poor rocks such as the quartzites which prevail in parts of the western Highlands, such habitats provide a local but important site for this vegetation among suites of oligotrophic heaths. Much more widely, however, the Nar dus-Galium grassland occurs on peaty gleys around soligenous flushes, the Agrostis-Poly trichum subcommunity often marking out a gradation from drier swards to calcifuge Caricion nigrae vegetation like the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire, the Carex nigra-Nardus sub-community of which has frequent Nardus, Anthoxanthum, Festuca ovina, Agrostis canina ssp. canina, Juncus squarrosus, Luzula multiflora and Polytrichum commune, as well as Carex echinata, C. nigra, C. demissa, Viola palustris and various Sphagna, most notably S. recurvum, S. auriculatum and 5. palustre. Where the irrigating waters are somewhat more base-rich, as occurs on slopes receiving run-off or seepage from calcareous rocks or drift, the Carex-Viola sub-community usually occurs in these transitional situations, either marking out flushed zones within tracts of more calcifuge Species-poor Nardus-Galium grassland or forming a surround to strongly basiphile mires like the Pingui-culo-Caricetum or, at higher altitudes, the Carici-Saxi-fragetum. Well-developed flushes with this kind of vege tation are usually clearly marked off from their context by their richness in calcicolous small sedges, dicotyledons and bryophytes, but transitional and fragmentary stands can be harder to delineate from the neighbouring swards, especially where the ground is much trampled by stock searching for a nourishing bite. Patterns of this kind are a striking feature of some of the Breadalbane Mountains, as over the slopes of Ben Lawers (Ratcliffe 1977) where McVean & Ratcliffe (1962) grouped some of the more strongly flushed transitions with Nardus in a distinct Hypno-Caricetum. Towards higher altitudes, it becomes difficult to dis tinguish between the Nardus-Galium grassland and the Nardus-Carex vegetation which has been largely unaffected by the burning and grazing prevalent over lower ground and which often has a distinctly chionophilous character. The two communities come closest on north-and east-facing slopes where shade maintains a particularly cool and moist atmosphere and where some prolongation of snow-lie provides shelter from the bit ing winds and an additional source of irrigating waters in late spring. Here, the Racomitrium sub-community, often with a local abundance of Scirpus cespitosus, can provide a surround to Typical Nardus-Carex snow-bed vegetation, a pattern well seen in some of the great corries on Beinn Eighe and certain of the Grampian mountains (Ratcliffe 1977). Almost everywhere else, treatments have interacted with soils and climate to complicate the kinds of vege tation patterns described above. First, there is the general feature that, where pastoral exploitation of hill grazings by choosy stock has been long and heavy, the Nardus-Galium grassland tends to occupy more of the ground in such sequences than would be the case if edaphic factors had exerted a greater control on its abundance, the community becoming deeply entrenched over the most suitable profiles and being at a https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.040 Published online by Cambridge University Press360 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities strong competitive advantage over better-quality swards on soils of a transitional character. Second, over ground of intermediate wetness and impoverishment, there can be seen all manner of fine variation in the composition and structure of the swards where grazing exerts its maximal influence on zonations between the Nardus-Galium grassland and other communities like the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, from sharply-delimited mosaics of close-cropped runnels between Nardus tussocks to much more ill-defined gradations between short and ranker swards. There is probably some measure of successional play in such patterning, whereby the boundaries can be sharpened up or allowed to become less clear with variations in grazing intensity, but because selective cropping tends to confirm the hold of Nardus in the swards, it is doubtful whether increased stocking with choosy animals can ever push back the limits of the Nardus-Galium grassland without imposing unacceptable pressure on the better-quality swards. Less selective stock, such as cattle, ponies and wethers, are probably better for this purpose, the first having the advantage of a heavier tread and more concentrated manuring, which helps break up the rank herbage and raise the fertility of the ground. Milton (1940) showed that controlled heavy grazing, with such dunging and trampling, could reduce the abundance of both Nardus and J. squarrosus in grasslands such as these, though in dense Nardus-Galium swards it is unknown whether the required closeness of grazing can be achieved without the stock suffering nutritional penalties (Nicholson et al. 1970, Grant et al. 1985). Little information is available on the detailed fate of Nardus-Galium grassland from which grazing has been withdrawn apart from the enclosure experiments at Moor House in the northern Pennines (Welch & Rawes 1964, Rawes 1981) and even here the changes are still in train after 20 years or so of protection from sheep and the results somewhat equivocal. But the most obvious indications are that, where Nardus has a strong hold in the swards over highly suitable soils, it declines little, or even increases its abundance, with enclosure, whereas if it is a relatively minor component over profiles that are not so moist and peaty, it declines, being overwhelmed in this case by plants such as Deschampsia flexuosa and Carex bigelowii. Similar observations were made by Ratcliffe (1959zz) on unplanted patches or failed areas within forestry enclosures in Snowdonia, where mixed Nardus, Festuca and Agrostis swards became dominated by D. flexuosa, A. capillaris, V. myrtillus and Calluna. And so it seems likely that, where Nardus is not unduly abundant, and perhaps at some competitive disadvantage once grazing is withdrawn, it is plants that can root in the mat of accumulating litter that are best able to thrive and subdue it. The likely successor to such changes through most of the altitudinal range of the Nardus-Galium grassland would be some sort of Vacci-nium-Deschampsia heath, and indeed this vegetation is frequently found among these swards, sharing many species with them and often grading imperceptibly with changes in dominance that are probably often under biotic control (Ratcliffe 1959a, McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, King & Nicholson 1964). At lower altitudes, heather can become important in such patterns, with the Nardus-Galium grassland occurring among Calluna-Vaccinium heath, particularly the Galium-Festuca sub community, or, through the southern Pennines, the Calluna-Deschampsia heath, or, over higher ground in the oceanic south-west of Britain, the Ulex gallii-Agrostis curtisii heath. It seems highly likely that in some regions sub-shrub vegetation of these kinds, rather than other grasslands, were the historical precursors to the Nardus-Galium swards. Certainly, Ratcliffe (1959a) and McVean & Ratcliffe (1962) adduced abundant evidence that repeated burning together with heavy grazing had con verted sub-montane heather communities to bilberry heath, Nardus-Galium and Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grasslands through much of the Southern Uplands, northern England and Wales, and was continuing to do so; and they supposed the same to be true of parts of the Highlands, particularly in the drier south-east Grampian region. And King (1960), from observations in parts of the Southern Uplands, suggested that the development of /Van7w5-dominance might be an intermittent but cumulative process related to the cyclic, but gradually less successful, regrowth of heather with repeated burning, or perhaps just after many generations of natural growth and ageing. It is, however, often impossible to tell whether particular tracts of Nardus-Galium grassland have developed in this secondary fashion or more directly from cleared forest and, in recent times, the latter process may have been the more widespread (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). What is clear is that reversion of the Nardus-Galium grassland to woodland with a relaxation of grazing is often problematic. Quite apart from the rarity of seed parents through much of the sub-montane zone, the thick, litter-choked herbage and peaty mat present a very uncongenial rooting medium for likely invaders such as species of birch and pine whose fruits, though wind-transportable over considerable distances, have but small food reserves to sustain root growth down to a mineral base; and, even then, this is a very impoverished substrate. The development of some surface heterogeneity subsequent to the spread and eventual death of sub-shrubs perhaps presents a better prospect: in the forestry enclosures which Ratcliffe (1959a) described, seedlings of Sorbus aucuparia were occasionally found among the heath. Theoretically, the kinds of forest that would be expected to grow on the better soils at present https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.040 Published online by Cambridge University PressU5 Nardus stricta-Galium saxatile grassland 361 occupied by the Nardus-Galium grassland would be the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland with, at higher altitudes, perhaps also the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland; but whether there is ever any real likelihood of a full succession to such vegetation, without some intervention such as burning off of the herbage, is unknown. The wetter and more impoverished soils are even less likely to support ready tree growth although, at lower altitudes, a bout of heavy cattle-grazing, with much trampling and manuring, might be a suitable preparation for enclosure and the development of rushy vegetation with spontaneous willow-dominated stands of Betula-Molinia woodland. Distribution "
"u6","Zonation and succession The community occurs widely with other kinds of grassland and with heaths and mires in vegetation patterns where edaphic differences and treatments are the major controlling variables. Although it is not true to say that J. squarrosus is never a constituent of climax vegetation (cf. Welch 19666), the kind of abundance that it shows here is under the strong influence of biotic factors and, in most situations, the Juncus-Festuca grassland is clearly an anthropogenic replacement for other types of vegetation. The clearest soil-related zonations involving the community are seen where the wet peaty profiles that it favours occur in sequences running from free-draining acidic mineral soils through to ombrogenous peats. Often, in such patterns, the Juncus-Festuca grassland grades, over moist peaty podzols, disposed over steeper slopes or more pervious ground, to some sort of Nardus-Galium grassland, the boundary between the vegetation types being frequently a matter of the dominance of https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.041 Published online by Cambridge University PressU6 Juncus squarrosus-Festuca ovina grassland 373 either J. squarrosus or Nardus against a background flora that can remain more or less uniform throughout. Thus, the Agrostis-Luzula and Vaccinium sub-communities of the Juncus-Festuca grassland can pass almost imperceptibly into Species-poor Nardus-Galium grassland, with a variety of fine-leaved grasses, V. myrtillus and pleurocarpous mosses frequent right through the swards. Or, on more strongly gleyed or flushed soils, or over shallow redistributed peats of varying degrees of wetness, there can be a continous zonation from the Carex-Calypogeia type of Juncus-Festuca grassland to the Agrostis-Poly trichum sub-community of the Nardus-Galium grassland, with Agrostis canina, Carex nigra, Polytrichum commune and Ptilidium ciliare common overall. Frequently, too, the Nardus-Galium grassland passes in turn to the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, typically a vegetation type of free-draining podzolic soils and base-poor brown earths, but extending in its Vaccinium-Nardus sub-community on to moister and more humic profiles. J. squarrosus does run on into such vegetation as an occasional associate and sometimes there can be a direct transition from the Juncus-Festuca community to the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland marked by a fairly sharp reduction in the abundance of the rush. In the opposite direction in this kind of zonation, the Juncus-Festuca grassland often gives way, with varying degrees of abruptness, to some type of blanket-mire vegetation developed over ombrogenous peats that thicken up with the move on to gently-sloping or flat ground. Typically, through the range of the community, this is the Calluna-Eriophorum bog or, in the southern Pennines and locally elsewhere, the very impoverished Eriophorum bog. With the gradual increase in peat depth and wetness over graded transitions to level ground, the Carex-Calypogeia and Sphagnum sub-communities can form a fairly gentle, uninterrupted zonation to such mire types, with species such as Eriophorum vaginatum, E. angustifolium, Scirpus cespitosus and the Sphagna becoming more important in the vegetation on moving towards the intact mire plane. And, in some cases, there is an intervening belt of Ericion wet heath, usually of the Scirpus-Erica type, the Vaccinium sub-community of which can make the transition between the grassland and the mire even more gradual and protracted. Complete patterns of this kind, uncomplicated by topographic variation or too many confusions deriving from treatments, are rare, but they can be seen in broad outline over many slopes and summits through the range of the community. Sometimes, the vegetation types are disposed over ground of increasing height and lessening slope so as to form a broad altitudinal zonation, a pattern clearly visible over the rounded tops of the Moorfoot and Moffat Hills (Smith 1918) in the Southern Uplands, on the terraced scenery of the Pen-nines (Adamson 1918, Eddy et al. 1969) and over some of the less calcareous mountains through the Breadal-bane range, as on Meall Ghaordie and Meall Na Samhna (Ratcliffe 1977). In more rugged scenery, like that of the Carneddau (Ratcliffe 1959a) and Cader Idris (Edgell 1969) in Wales, the patterns tend to be more complex and fragmented and, over the craggy high ground of the north-west Highlands, the community becomes distinctly infrequent, though the massively-rounded watersheds of Beann Dearg and Seana Bhraig show a characteristic zonation (Ratcliffe 1977). In this more oceanic part of the uplands, too, there is a strong tendency for suitably gentle ground, which is usually to be found over the stepped landscape at lower altitudes, to have vegetation with much Molinia over the wet peats around the fringes of blanket mire. Here, zonations with the Molinia-Potentilla mire, Afb/zma-dominated Scir pus-Erica wet heath and the Scirpus-Eriophorum mire present an oceanic equivalent to patterns with the Juncus-Festuca community from less equable parts of the north and west and, in some localities, mixed sequences with elements of both kinds of transition can be found. A variety of other complexities is often seen. For one thing, natural drying of the peats around the margins of many of our high-level blanket mires, frequently exacerbated by draining, burning and pollution, has resulted in many places in baffling patchworks of eroding and recolonising bog, wet heath, and Juncus-Festuca and Nardus-Galium grasslands over fragments of intact mire and redistributed peat washed down over the slopes below. This kind of pattern is shown to perfection on the map of Moor House produced by Eddy et al. (1969). Then, the zonations described above are frequently cut through by vegetation types which pick out seepage lines, flushes, water-tracks and streams. The Juncus-Festuca grassland can itself mark such sites within tracts of drier grasslands, occurring over irrigated ground and along the periodically-flooded terraces of streams, but often it occurs as a transitional zone around stands of soligenous mire vegetation on the more or less permanently waterlogged peats and humic gleys. The commonest pattern of this kind involves the Carex echinata-Sphagnum mire, the most widespread of our sub-montane sedge-or rush-dominated base-poor flushes and the Carex-Nardus sub-community of that vegetation can grade continuously with the Carex-Calypogeia sub community of the Juncus-Festuca grassland, such spe cies as A. canina, C. nigra, J. squarrosus, F. ovina and P. commune occurring throughout, but with a noticeable increase in poor-fen herbs and Sphagna in moving on to wetter ground. Again, this kind of zonation is well shown on the map of Moor House (Eddy et al. 1969) and on that from Cader Idris (Edgell 1969). Further complexities occur where such irrigation brings a measure of base-enrichment, something that is widely seen on the hills between Breadalbane and Clova, https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.041 Published online by Cambridge University Press374 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities where there is seepage from Dalradian Limestone and calcareous metasediments, through those parts of the Pennines where Carboniferous Limestone or drift de rived from it are important elements in the landscape and, more locally, where there is seepage from limy partings among shales and sandstones or calcareous intrusions. In such situations, well-defined flushes are generally occupied by the strikingly calcicolous Pingui-culo-Caricetum or, on higher ground, by the Carici-Saxifragetum, but, where the water trickles through Juncus-Festuca vegetation, there can be a flushed zone of the Agrostis-Luzula sub-community with a moderately basiphile character. In other cases, the Carex sub community of the Nardus-Galium grassland, sometimes with locally abundant J. squarrosus, can also occur on the irrigated ground and, where there are more free-draining lime-rich soils on the slopes around, the Fes tuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland is replaced there by the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland. The flanks of Ben Lawers have good patterns of this kind with the more calcifuge zonations to soligenous mires occurring in close proximity (Ratcliffe 1977). Then there are the effects of treatments, which interact with the edaphic influences over the full range of soils on which the Juncus-Festuca vegetation occurs. On exposed slopes at higher altitudes, the community sometimes grades, through the Vaccinium sub-community, to wind-blasted heath maintained by harsh climatic con ditions, but for the most part it is an anthropogenic vegetation type whose general abundance over wet, peaty ground through the hill pastures of the north and west is a reflection of the spread of J. squarrosus in damp swards with uncontrolled, selective grazing. Even on soils which are just moist, such treatment may still give the plant a strong competitive edge against many of the fine-leaved grasses of calcifuge swards though, being a little more palatable than Nardus, it probably loses out to this plant where both species are at home edaphically. However, where heavy grazing has been combined with burning over wet heaths and blanket mires, a commonplace through many upland areas, the Juncus-Festuca community can extend into situations which would never support vigorous Nardus-Galium grassland. By affecting balances of this kind, complex histories of land use, involving episodes of burning and local variations in grazing intensity, have undoubtedly played a large part in the development of the patchworks of vegetation seen in places like Moor House (Welch 1967, Eddy et al. 1969). Reversing the advance of J. squarrosus by manipulations of continued grazing is difficult, particularly in the severely run-down landscape of eroded bog margins. Among grasslands, Milton (1940) showed how, with a shift to the kind of heavy grazing, trampling and dunging that cattle and ponies provide, the abundance of both J. squarrosus and Nardus can be reduced in the type of vegetation included here, but achieving this over extensive tracts of hill land without damaging the betterquality swards in the mosaic is another matter. Relaxation of grazing, on the other hand, is a readier way of eliminating J. squarrosus because, unlike Nardus, its squarrose rosettes are readily overwhelmed by taller herbage and the accumulation of litter. In the enclosure experiments at Moor House, for example, the rush was all but eliminated from the Vaccinium sub-community by tussocky growth of D. flexuosa and F. ovina after just seven years of protection, while, in vegetation approximating to the Carex-Calypogeia type, Eriophorum vagi natum and D. flexuosa completely extinguished it after a decade (Welch & Rawes 1964, Rawes 1981). On peats such as those of this latter site, the Calluna-Eriophorum mire is probably the natural climax vegetation, though reversion to impoverished Eriophorum mire is perhaps more likely over drying blanket-bog fringes (Ratcliffe 1959a, Rawes 1981). Over thinner deposits and redistributed peat, the likely successor with reduction of grazing is some sort of Scirpus-Erica wet heath, perhaps the Vaccinium type with its mixtures of V. myrtillus, Erica tetralix and Calluna with J. squarrosus, Nardus and occasional small fine-leaved grasses and pleurocarps. Then, over peaty mineral soils, the Juncus-Festuca grassland may revert to Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, the Alchemilla-Carex sub-community of which comes close in its floristics to the Agrostis-Luzula and Vaccinium sub-communities here. Throughout its range, the Jun cus-Festuca vegetation is found with these different kinds of heath in mosaics which are probably controlled mainly by differences in grazing intensity and frequency of burning. Towards lower altitudes and over soils which are not too wet or impoverished, it is possible that withdrawal of grazing from such patchworks could permit succession through heath to forest, perhaps some kind of Betula-Molinia or Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland, but this is unlikely over more inhospitable ground at higher altitudes. Distribution "
"u7","Zonation and succession The Nardus-Carex grass-heath is characteristically found with sub-shrub vegetation, snow-bed communities and mires in the low-and middle-alpine zones of our higher mountains, where vegetation patterns are influenced mostly by differences in exposure and soil moisture, themselves in turn much dependent on topography. Towards higher altitudes, the community often gives way to summit moss-heath or fell-field, while below it usually passes to heaths and grasslands among which anthropogenic factors become of increasing importance. Essentially, the Nardus-Carex vegetation can be seen as an extension downwards of grass-and sedge-dominated heath into the zone of sub-shrub communities where there is locally prolonged snow-lie through the winter and spring, and it is usually associated towards its lower levels with some kind of moderately chionophilous bilberry vegetation. Most often, this is the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath which, throughout the range of the Nardus-Carex heath but especially in the Grampians, tends to replace it whenever snow melts a little earlier and the waters drain away rather more sharply (Figure 33). The zonation between the two communities is partly a broad altitudinal one, with the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath becoming increasingly important over sheltered ground towards the transition to the sub alpine, the Nardus-Carex community petering out generally below around 600 m, the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath often extending down to 400 m. But, within the low-alpine zone, mostly between 600 and 800 m, the vegetation types frequently occur together, dis posed over ground that is sheltered to varying degrees or where differences in slope affect the readiness with which melt-water drains away. One community can thus give way to the other with shifts in aspect, north-and east facing slopes providing sufficient shelter and shade for the Nardus-Carex grass-heath to replace the Vaccinium-Deschampsia vegetation, or with changes in slope, a pattern well seen over the treads and risers of terraced ground on the Cairngorms (Burges 1951) and, of course, https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.042 Published online by Cambridge University PressU7 Nardus stricta-Carex bigelowii grass-heath 383 around distinct snow-beds, several examples of which were illustrated by McVean & Ratcliffe (1962). In the Cairngorms, which has a greater range of chionophilous vegetation than any other mountain system in Britain, a moderately late snow-bed in the low-alpine zone characteristically has a central patch of Nardus-Carex vege tation, usually of the Empetrum-Cetraria type, but with Scirpus often thickening up on the wettest ground towards the base, with an arch of Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath on the steeper back face. Essentially similar patterns occur on Monadhliath and right down through the east-central Highlands, particularly on Beinn a’Ghlo, and then more locally in the western Highlands, over the Fannich and Monar hills, on Ben Wyvis and Beinn Dearg, though from Breadalbane to Clova, and at lower altitudes to the west, the Typical sub-community increasingly replaces the Empetrum-Cetraria type. The absolute differences in length of snow-lie and soil wet ness which control the switch from the Nardus-Carex to the Vaccinium-Deschampsia vegetation are still un known but, floristically, the major change is in a move from Nardus dominance to an abundance of sub-shrubs, the low canopy of the heath being particularly rich in V. myrtillus and E. nigrum, with ssp. nigrum appearing at lower altitudes, and V. vitis-idaea also occurring fre-Figure 33.

C. bigelowii becomes just occasional, R. lanuginosum is much less abundant and plants like J. squarrosus and S. cespitosus hardly ever appear in the heath but there is often strong continuity through the grasses and other cryptogams. The two vegetation types come especially close in the Empetrum-Racomitrium sub community of the heath, but the Hylocomium-Rhytidiadelphus type grades into Typical Nardus-Carex heath and the Alchemilla-Carex sub-community into the Alchemilla-Festuca sub-community here, and zonations can be found with each of these pairs. In some places, too, the patterns are complicated by the occurrence of the Vaccinium-Rubus heath, a community which seems to be about as chionophilous as the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, but where the substrate is generally sodden peat and where R. chamaemorus, Cornus suecica and Sphagna provide a diagnostic element. On moving up through the low-alpine zone, and especially towards the wetter west, on Creag Meagaidh, Bidean Nam Bian, around Glen Affric, on the Fannich Hills, Ben Hope and Ben More Assynt, the Nardus-Carex grass-heath is quite often found among mixtures of the above vegetation types and the Deschampsia-Galium grassland, this latter often also extending up to 800 m or more and marking out slopes with moderately long snow-lie and, more particularly, sustained irrigation by the trickling of melt-water and rain. Here again, there can be marked continuity among the grass and pleurocarp elements of the vegetation but the change from Nardus to D. cespitosa as the dominant is usually obvious enough. With the shift to snowier slopes at higher altitudes, locally through the western Highlands, as around Beinn Dearg, the Monar Forest and the Affric-Cannich Hills, but more widely over Monadhliath and particularly the Cairngorms, the proportion of more strikingly chionophilous vegetation increases and here the Nardus-Carex grass-heath is most commonly represented by the Empetrum-Cetraria sub-community, frequently forming a surround to various kinds of very late snow-bed vegetation. Through the central Highlands, this is often the Carex-Poly trichum sedge-heath, where plants such as C. bigelowii, Polytrichum alpinum, Cetraria islandica, Cla donia arbuscula and C. uncialis maintain a strong qualitative continuity, but where Nardus becomes very sparse and the sedge generally dominant with much Dicranum fuscescens, a moss that is only occasional and usually of low cover in the Nardus-Carex grass-heath. Quite fre quently, in the Cairngorms, there is some slight difference between the Empetrum-Cetraria vegetation above the snow-bed and that, some 100-150 m downslope, on the gentler ground below. It is in the former situation that lichens such as Cladonia bellidiflora and Cetraria delisei tend to be better represented, with Scirpus more prominent in the latter, but this variation is not so https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.042 Published online by Cambridge University Press384 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities striking as that implied by McVean & Ratcliffe's (1962) separation of a higher Nardetum medio-alpinum from their Nardus-Trichophorum nodum. In other places, where snow lies longest of all, it is the moss-dominated vegetation of the Polytrichum-Kiaeria or Salix-Racomitrium communities that occurs within a surrounding zone of the Nardus-Carex heath. Here, the boundaries between the less and more chionophilous vegetation are usually well marked by a reduction in the abundance of C. bigelowii, increased frequency of such plants as Salix herbacea, Saxifraga stellaris and Omalo-theca supina, and prominence of snow-tolerant bryophytes like Racomitrium heterostichum, Kiaeria starkei, Conostomum tetragonum, Polytrichum sexangulare, Oligotrichum hercynicum and Gymnomitrium concinnatum. McVean & Ratcliffe (1962) provide a sketch of a snow-bed complex from over 1200 m in the Cairngorms where lichen-rich Empetrum-Cetraria vegetation forms a fringe around a nivation hollow, with the Polytrichum-Kiaeria community marking out the patches of deepest and longest snow-lie and running along the relatively stable dry watercourses. There is also Salix-Racomi-trium vegetation on stone-striped ridges running down between the snow patches where there is intermittent irrigation and downwash. In some localities, where stabilised block scree, tumbled boulders or ledges occur in those beds where snow lies longest, the Cryptogramma-Athyrium community can be found in close juxtaposition with the Nardus-Carex grass-heath, its clumps of ferns benefiting by the protection that the snow cover provides, usually marking out the stands clearly. In the Cairngorms, and less extensively over high ground elsewhere through the east-central Highlands, the context for these late snow-beds is usually Juncus-Racomitrium fell-field which extends up, on gently-sloping and flat areas, over the summits of these mountains where exposure can be severe. The floristic differences between this and the Nardus-Carex heath are not always very marked, particularly where, in the fell-field vegetation, both C. bigelowii and R. lanuginosum are abundant with scattered grasses and a rich and extensive lichen flora. Moreover, extensive tracts of Juncus-Racomitrium vegetation are the exception, the usual picture being of a network of erosion surfaces, among which gentle hollows and shallow basins which accumulate a little snow can have patches of Nardus-Carex grass-heath, the boundaries between the communities being often complex and sometimes diffuse. But, as a general guide, Nardus is scarce in the fell-field and Juncus-trifidus is typically at least co-dominant. Even at some sites within the east-central Highlands, then down through the Grampians, on Carn Gorm, Ben More and Ben Alder, and increasingly with the shift to the more oceanic mountains of the western Highlands, flat and gently-sloping ground of this kind, with moderate exposure over summits and spurs, has some kind of Carex-Racomitrium moss-heath. This occurs through roughly the same altitudinal zone as the Nardus-Carex grass-heath, replacing it wherever a combination of lack of shelter with reasonably sharp drainage gives R. lanuginosum a strong, competitive advantage in the cool, humid climate. It can thus run up, around and beyond low-alpine snow-beds, on to higher ground, occurring very extensively over the tops of more rounded mountains of north-west Scotland such as Beinn Dearg and Ben Wyvis, or provide a general context for Nardus-Carex and Deschampsia-Galium snow-fields over slopes that are too freely draining to have blanket mire, as can be seen through the Kintail-Glen Affric district. In their floras, the Carex-Racomitrium and Nardus-Carex com munities show great continuity, with C. bigelowii, V. myrtillus, D. flexuosa, G. saxatile, R. lanuginosum, Cla donia uncialis and Cetraria islandica occurring very commonly through both, but Nardus is only very occasional in the former vegetation type, where dominance almost always lies with R. lanuginosum or mixtures of this with C. bigelowii and V. myrtillus. Nonetheless, Typical sub-communities of each come very close in their composition and the Galium type of Carex-Raco-mitrium heath can intergrade with the Alchemilla-Festuca sub-community of the Nardus-Carex vegetation. With the shift on to exposed situations over gently-sloping spurs and summits at lower altitudes, dwarfed sub-shrub heaths with abundant mosses or lichens tend to replace these communities in patterns with the Nar dus-Carex grass-heath. In the more oceanic west, R. lanuginosum and bulky pleurocarps are very prominent in such vegetation and through the low-alpine zone there, particularly where the ground becomes rough and rocky, the Vaccinium-Racomitrium heath characteristically replaces the Nardus-Carex community where the slopes are less sheltered and snow-bound. V. myrtillus and/or E. nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum and the mosses are usually co-dominant in the heath, but plants like C. bigelowii, D. flexuosa, G. saxatile and Nardus can all occur very commonly and, in the widespread Cetraria sub-community, a variety of lichens enhances the floristic continuity between the vegetation types. Moving down into the sub-alpine zone in the western Highlands, Calluna becomes increasingly important in such dwarfed heaths, with Arctostaphylos spp. figuring more locally, and then the Nardus-Carex grass-heath gives way over very exposed brows to some kind of Calluna-Racomitrium or Calluna-A. alpinus vegetation, sub shrubs again becoming an abundant element in the cover, though the canopy is often very stunted and patchy in the wind-blasted conditions. Through the https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.042 Published online by Cambridge University PressU7 Nardus stricta-Carex bigelowii grass-heath 385 east-central Highlands, directly comparable zonations and mosaics can be seen where moderately late snowbeds occur z among exposed spurs, although here it is lichens that have uncompromising dominance in the ground layer, the Vaccinium-Cladonia heath running up with the Nardus-Carex vegetation to the middle-alpine, the Calluna-Cladonia heath extending right down among the lower altitude snow-beds to the sub-alpine. The Racomitrium sub-community of the former and the Cladonia sub-community of the latter can be seen as floristic transitions to Nardus-Carex vegetation where slight hollows or a shift in aspect provide a modest amount of shelter. In large-scale altitudinal zonations, the low-alpine sub-shrub communities and snow-beds give way below to heaths and grasslands which are strongly modified by anthropogenic activities, being maintained essentially by grazing and burning. Among the varied patchworks of vegetation types clothing these lower slopes, the Nardus-Galium grassland makes the closest approach to the Nardus-Carex grass-heath, particularly where it runs on to sunless aspects at rather higher altitudes than is usual, where, in its Racomitrium sub-community, R. lanuginosum, and S. cespitosus become common with occasional C. bigelowii, E. nigrum, and Cetraria among the abundant Nardus surrounding the more obviously chionophilous vegetation. In other situations, patches of wetter grassland with Nardus and J. squarrosus, usually some kind of Juncus-Festuca vegetation, can occur on wetter peaty soils transitional to blanket peat mantling the shelving slopes at lower altitudes. Indeed, in the east-central Highlands, ombrogenous bog of the Calluna-Eriophorum type is quite a common context for snow-beds over gentle peat-bearing slopes at even very high altitudes and, where melt-water emerges in springs from patches of Nardus-Carex grass-heath and runs into such vegetation, a stand of the Philonoto-Saxifragetum often marks the spring and its vigorous rills. Distribution "
"u8","Zonation and succession The Carex-Polytrichum sedge-heath occurs in the low-and middle-alpine zones of the central Highlands with a variety of other chionophilous communities, fell-field vegetation and dwarfed sub-shrub heath in zonations and mosaics that depend largely on the degree of exposure over the slopes and summit plateaus. Moving further west, there is an increasing tendency for the vegetation of all but the latest snow-beds to be replaced by their more oceanic equivalents, and the Carex-Polytrichum sedge-heath persists only very locally among these sequences in the western Highlands. In shifting down into the sub-alpine zone throughout the range of the community, there are transitions to heaths and grasslands that are increasingly anthropogenic in their origin. The most complete range of chionophilous vegetation through the heartland of the Carex-Polytrichum sedgeheath in the central Highlands is to be seen over the north-facing slopes of the Cairngorms, where the community occurs among a suite of snow-field vege tation disposed according to variation in length of snow lie, ease of drainage and the amount of instability due to freeze-thaw and creep. Where the snow cover persists fairly long, the Carex-Polytrichum sedge-heath may represent the most chionophilous vegetation type of the sequence, occupying the centre of small snow-beds or filling larger concavities which accumulate drifts, or covering more extensive tracts in patchy fashion over generally sheltered gentle slopes. Around it as an enclosing zone, or forming mosaics with it on ground that has fine patchworks of less and more exposed areas, there is often to be found the Nardus-Carex grass-heath, zonations between the two vegetation types being sometimes very gradual. C. bigelowii, Poly trichum alpinum, Cetraria islandica, Cladonia arbuscula and C. uncialis give a strong measure of continuity, particularly where the Poly trichum-Ptilidium sub-community of the sedgeheath occurs with the Empetrum-Cetraria sub-community of the grass-heath, but the increasing prominence of Nardus and reduction of moss cover are usually suffi cient to define the boundary. Where the snow cover is a little less persistent or the drainage of the melt-water more free, the Dicranum-Racomitrium sub-community of the sedge-heath and the Typical or Alchemilla-Festuca forms of the grass-heath can occur together in similar patterns, with V. myrtillus as well as Nardus, and often too pleurocarpous mosses, becoming more prominent with the shift on to less snow-bound slopes. This kind of sequence frequently continues into some sort of Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath, a vegetation type of moderately sheltered and often rather steeper, better-drained ground, where dominance generally lies with the sub-shrubs. Running down into the sub-alpine, this community often forms a patchy zone of fairly chionophilous vegetation below the altitudes at which the Carex-Polytrichum sedge-heath is best represented (Figure 34). Where the snow cover persists longer than is usual over the community, as in the very latest snow-beds that are such a distinctive feature on the sunless northern slopes of the Cairngorms, the Carex-Polytrichum vege tation typically gives way to a patch of either the Poly trichum-Kiaeria or, on more unstable ground, the Salix-Racomitrium community. There, C. bigelowii and Polytrichum alpinum can both remain fairly frequent, but they are rarely abundant and dominance usually lies with such snow-tolerant bryophytes as P. sexangulare, K. starkei, R. heterostichum, Conostomum tetragonum, Oligotrichum hercynicum and Gymnomitrium concinna-tum, with common records for Salix herbacea, Saxifraga stellaris and Omalotheca supina. Common variations on this basic theme can be seen where melt-waters emerge from late snow-beds in dis tinct springs where the Pohlietum glacialis, with its striking apple-green carpets of P. wahlenbergii var. glacialis, is characteristic, or, where the snow-lie is not https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.043 Published online by Cambridge University Press392 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities quite so long, the Sphagno-Anthelietum, with its swelling masses of Anthelia julacea. High-altitude stands of the Philonoto-Saxifragetum, dominated by Philonotis fon-tana, Dicranella palustris and Scapania undulata, can also be found where swift-running rills carry away melt from the Car ex-Poly trichum sedge-heath. Then, where the gentle slopes carrying the community give way to rocky or boulder-strewn ground with long-persistent Figure 34. Patterns in and around snow-beds.

Very typically, over the high summits of the Cairngorms, the zone of low-and middle-alpine communities developed on the more snow-bound slopes gives way to Juncus-Racomitrium fell-field. This is itself a somewhat chionophilous vegetation type in many situations, extending often on to moderately sheltered ground where there can be an intermittent powdering of snow up to 50 cm or so deep throughout the winter (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962) and it can form a fringe over the convex upper margins of snow-beds, surrounding the Carex-Poly trichum sedge-heath itself, or grading to it through an intervening zone of Nardus-Carex grassheath. Frequently, though, it occurs in a network of loose erosion surfaces over more exposed plateaus, with the more chionophilous vegetation picking out distinct shallow basins. C. bigelowii, R. lanuginosum and many of the lichens continue as frequent components of the fell-field, but mosses are generally sparse, and J. trifidus, an uncommon plant in Carex-Polytrichum sedge-heath, is a constant and often abundant feature. The geographical range of the Juncus-Racomitrium heath is very strongly confined to a small part of the east central Highlands: it occurs patchily on some other summits around the Cairngorms but over the plateaus of Lochnagar and in parts of the Clova-Caenlochan area, for example, it is extensive tracts of the Carex-Polytrichum sedge-heath itself that are the most obvious feature of gentle high-altitude slopes. And, with the shift westwards to Ben Alder and on its northern outliers in the Affric-Cannich Hills and on Ben Wyvis, the Carex-Polytrichum community gives way to the more oceanic Carex-Racomitrium heath where later snow-beds occur in stretches of level or gently-sloping ground that are more exposed. J. trifidus continues as a locally prominent plant in such vegetation but the most striking feature is the great abundance of R. lanuginosum which generally serves to distinguish the community from the Carex-Polytrichum sedge-heath. However, there is much floristic continuity between the two vegetation types and the Dicranum-Racomitrium sub-community, in particular, with its frequent records for R. lanuginosum, V. myrtillus and grasses, can grade gently into the moss-heath. Increasingly over these western hills, too, the Deschampsia-Galium grassland occurs among sequences of chionophilous vegetation, forming extensive tracts over moderately snow-bound slopes and those well irrigated by melt-water. In its Rhytidiadelphus sub-community, of gentler and more snow-bound hill sides, it comes quite close to the Dicranum-Racomitrium type of Carex-Polytrichum sedge-heath, although the abundance of R. loreus and Hylocomium splendens will usually mark the boundary between the vegetation types. https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.043 Published online by Cambridge University PressU8 Carex bigelowii-Poly trichum alpinum sedge-heath 393 Distribution "
"u9","Zonation and succession The Juncus-Racomitrium heath is characteristically found at the limit of the vegetated zone, terminating an altitudinal sequence of sub-shrub and grass-dominated heaths and occurring with snow-field communities in zonations and mosaics that largely reflect the degree of exposure in shifting on to higher ground and less sheltered aspects. Where there is some relief from the incessant wind and harsh frosts characteristic of the environment of the Juncus-Racomitrium heath, the community usually gives way to the Nardus-Carex grass-heath. The two vege tation types show considerable floristic continuity through frequent records in both for C. bigelowii, V. myrtillus, D. flexuosa, R. lanuginosum, Cetraria islandica, Cladonia arbuscula and C. uncialis, but J. trifidus is very scarce in the Nardus-Carex heath and Nardus is generally very abundant, often with frequent E. nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum and V. uliginosum and plants indi cative of soil wetness induced by snow-melt. On a large scale, the Juncus-Racomitrium heath is replaced by the more chionophilous community in moving to the northern and eastern slopes of the Cairngorms, in the lee of the prevailing winds and where the ground receives much less insolation, and in shifting down into the low-alpine zone. There the Nardus-Carex heath represents a transition to sub-shrub heaths like the Vaccinium-Deschampsia vegetation which are moderately chionophilous but developed over less windy and more humid slopes than the Juncus-Racomitrium heath. More locally, however, the Nardus-Carex heath takes over from the Juncus-Racomitrium heath wherever slight shifts in topography induce a little more accumulation https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.044 Published online by Cambridge University Press400 Calcifugous grasslands and montane communities and persistence of snow, as in hollows or behind spurs and bluffs. And, where there is marked snow-lie in particularly sheltered and shady spots, this may in turn give way to a late snow-bed community, producing sometimes finely-grained mosaics of less and more chio nophilous vegetation. Within patches of the Nardus-Carex heath, for example, there can be a central zone of the Carex-Polytrichum sedge-heath with its striking carpets of Polytrichum alpinum and Dicranum fuscescens, of the Polytrichum-Kiaeria moss-heath with abundant K. starkei, or of the Salix-Racomitrium community with R. heterostichum and crusts of hepatics and the dwarf willow. Or, in more sudden zonations, the Juncus-Racomitrium heath may pass directly to one or other of these kinds of vegetation. Especially distinctive are the very small-scale patterns produced by the local development of tiny patches of the Salix-Racomitrium community within the depressed centres of old rush tussocks (Ingram 1958). In other places, fields of windswept gravel contain sheltered stretches of boulders where the Cryptogramma-Athyrium community marks out late snow-lie. This particular range of vegetation types shows its full development only over the higher slopes and plateaus of the Cairngorms. Outlying stands of the Juncus-Racomitrium heath can be found in similar zonations elsewhere in the central Highlands and, in the form of the Salix sub-community, at a very few localities further west, but even around the Cairngorms there is a tendency for this kind of vegetation to be replaced in these sequences by the Carex-Racomitrium heath in situations that are a little more sheltered and, moving towards the more oceanic western Highlands, this community quickly prevails, eventually extending on to even the bleakest ablation surfaces. The change is already visible in shifting to the western spurs and ridges of the Cairngorms above Glen Feshie and, on exposed ground over the high plateaus of Lochnagar, there are extensive transitions between the Cladonia-Cetraria sub-community of the Juncus-Racomitrium heath and Typical Carex-Racomitrium heath, the switch from the one vegetation type to the other being marked by a reduction in lichen cover, an increase in the abundance of R. lanuginosum and the loss of J. trifidus. Distribution "
"w1","Zonation and succession On the margins of open waters, the Salix-Galium woodland often forms a patchy fringe behind some kind of swamp vegetation growing on the wetter mineral sub strates, e.g. the Phragmitetum australis, Typhetum latifo-liae, Sparganietum erecti, Caricetum ripariae or Carice-turn vesicariae. In more extensive transitions, there can be an intervening zone of Phragmites-Eupatorium or Phragmites-Urtica fen or complex mosaics of woodland, fen and swamp which reflect the extent and pattern of colonisation by woody vegetation: such patchworks are a common feature of silted pools, disused ponds and canals and larger loops of sluggish streams. On occasion, the community can pass, towards drier ground, to some type of Alnus-Urtica woodland but, very frequently, agricultural improvement almost to the margins of open waters means that stands of the Salix-Galium woodland give way to modified herbaceous vegetation. Such transitions may be gradual, as in ill-drained farmland around field ponds, where the community may pass to grazed Holco-Juncetum or Lolio-Cynosuretum. In other cases, sharp treatment-related boundaries terminate the sequence more abruptly and the woodland remains isolated within an intensive agricultural landscape. Some other particular contexts of the Salix-Galium woodland deserve special mention. In roadside ditches, the community can occur in linear stands which on occasion function as hedges and here it is usually fronted by some kind of mown Arrhenatheretum. In dune slacks, it can form a zone between the Salix repens-Holcus lanatus community on wetter ground and some kind of grassland or heath on the drier fixed sand around. Where the community occurs in the laggs of raised mires, it gives way towards the mire centre to herbaceous bog vegetation or, where trees have colonised the drying peat surface, to the Betula-Molinia woodland. Serai developments of the Salix-Galium woodland have not been followed but, in its usual position in topogenous wetlands with mineral soils, it would seem most likely that the community would be replaced by Alnus-Urtica woodland with increased terrestrialisation. Extension of an Alnus glutinosa or Betula pubescens canopy above the sallows and an increase in Urtica dioica, Rubusfruticosus agg. and dryopteroid ferns in the field layer would result in a composition akin to that found in the Sambucus or Betula sub-communities of that woodland type. Salix-Galium woodland as defined here is not a precursor to the richer kinds of carr on fen peats. In more exposed localities, as around the coasts of Cornwall, west Wales and western Scotland, the community may represent the end-point of colonisation by woody species on wetter mineral soils. Distribution "
"w10","Zonation and succession Zonations between different kinds of Quercus-Pteri-dium-Rubus woodland and transitions to other woodland types are primarily related to edaphic variation. https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.015 Published online by Cambridge University PressW10 Quercus robur-Pteridium aquilinum-Rubus fruticosus woodland 185 Treatment differences produce effects of their own but they can also emphasise or confuse soil-related patterns. Marginal zonations sometimes represent successional changes but very often now agricultural use of the surrounding land produces artificially abrupt transitions to herbaceous vegetation. By far the commonest kinds of edaphic zonations within stands of the community are related to differences in soil moisture, most frequently changes in the extent and frequency of surface-water gleying. Often these are related directly to variations in slope with the Typical or Acer-0xalis sub-communities picking out areas with better surface drainage, often here on ground with only a very gentle slope, and the Anemone sub community marking hollows and plateau tops. Similar patterns can be seen where ground-water gleying produces local areas of wetter soil along the sides of streams flowing through Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland (as in the transect in Pigott 1982). Quite frequently, such zonations continue into some kind of alder woodland. Around slope flushes, for example, there is often a transition to the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland. This may be quite gradual, with a progressive increase in herbs such as Deschampsia cespitosa or Juncus effusus and a slow switch to Alnus-dominance. In other cases, there is an abrupt appearance of Carex remota or C. pendula in sharply-defined patches. Both these kinds of zonation are very well seen along the base of the Lower Greensand in the Weald and on slopes cut into the Coal Measure shales of the Pennines. Where there is local peat accumulation in small river valleys, the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland may give way to small stands of the Alnus-Carex woodland, quite a common pattern in the Weald again and in some Essex woods (e.g. Rackham 1980, Wheeler 1980c). In other cases, it is the Alnus-Urtica woodland which terminates the sequence on alluvial flats, the appearance of Urtica dioica and Galium aparine marking the transition to more eutrophic soils. The other very common kind of zonation to other woodland types is related to differences in the base status of the soils. Very often, sites in which the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland is represented cover geological transitions to bedrocks or superficials which are either more or less calcareous. Where there is a switch to limestones, lime-rich shales or clays or to drift with more calcium carbonate, the community characteristically passes to the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland on more base-rich soils, usually brown earths, calcareous stagnogleys or pelosols, more rarely free-draining rendzinas. Sharp alternations of different bedrocks, especially typical here of the Cretaceous and Eocene sequences of the south-east, or abrupt differences in the nature of superficials (as at Gamlingay: Adamson 1912), can be marked by equally well defined floristic zona tions, with an abrupt switch in dominance from Pteridium or Holcus mollis to Mercurialis and its calcicolous associates. In the south-east, such transitions generally involve a move from the Typical, Anemone or Hedera sub-community of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland to the Primula-Glechoma, Anemone or Hedera sub community of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland respectively. To the north-west, the zonation is typically from the Acer-0xalis sub-community of the former woodland to the Geranium sub-community of the latter. It should be remembered, though, that a number of important species occur in both these kinds of woodland and, where there is a continuation of a Hyacinthoides carpet, say, under a canopy of Q. robur, Tilia, Carpinus and Corylus, the boundary between the communities may be blurred. Such gradual transitions are especially characteristic of heavy superficial deposits in the southeast, where there may be diffuse variations in the calcium carbonate content of the parent material and a complex mosaic of brown earths or stagnogleys with small but critical differences in base-status. Where the characteristic soils of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland give way to strongly-leached brown earths, brown podzolic soils or podzols, the community is replaced by the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland. Typically, here, this kind of transition is related to a geological switch from shales or clays to some kind of arenaceous bedrock or sandy superficial deposit. Such patterns can be seen in the south-east in the Cretaceous sequences of the Weald and they are very common to the north and west where, in Carboniferous deposits, alternations of shales and grits form the basis of much of the scenery along the fringes of the Pennine uplands in Derbyshire, South and West Yorkshire and Durham. Here, the Acer-Oxalis sub-community characteristically occupies the much-weathered dips of cuestas and the lower slopes of the valley sides, with the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland clothing the more resistant grit scarps. Sharp transitions between these kinds of woodland are quite common and, though Pteridium continues through both with Q. petraea and B. pendula figuring in the canopy of each, the springtime boundary of Hyacinthoides and the restriction of Fraxinus, A. pseudoplatanus and Corylus to the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland generally serve to delimit the communities. In some situations, though, the zonation is not so clear. On steeper slopes, slipping is quite common, with grit blocks tumbling down over the incompetent shales and then there can be a patchy inter-digitation of the two kinds of woodland along the slope foot. Even on more stable slopes, terracing is frequent and then every tread may be clothed with vegetation resembling the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus field layer, every riser with Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia herbs (e.g. Woodhead 1906, Scur-https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press186 Woodlands and scrub field 1953). When Hyacinthoides has faded from the patches of the former, such mosaics are typically marked by a patterning of Holcus mollis and Deschampsia flexuosa (Jowett & Scurfield 1949, 1952). Holcus seems to hold its own on the less sharply draining areas and also tends to hold the litter, the decay of which helps maintain the more mull-like qualities of the soils. Indeed, there is evidence that Holcus can invade the Deschampsia patches in these kinds of mosaic (Ovington 1953). Particularly in the south-east, where the effects of traditional sylviculture have persisted more extensively, coppicing treatments can confuse these soil-related tran sitions. Most obviously, where a uniform treatment has been applied across edaphic zonations, identical covers of underwood can continue over what are really the field layers of different communities. This is very common here across junctions between the Quercus-P ter idium-Rubus woodland and the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland, both of which have been widely cropped for hazel, lime and hornbeam. Under dense underwood, especially of the heavily-shading Tilia, herbs become very sparse so there may be only the very slightest indication of where one community ends and the other begins. Even within sites made up wholly of Quercus-P ter i-dium-Rubus woodland, coppicing produces its own pat terns of variation which are superimposed, often quite independently, over floristic differences related to, say, soil moisture. In actively-coppiced woodland, compartments marked out by varied and striking post-coppice herbaceous vegetation at different stages of development can thus provide an interruption to zonations between the Typical and Anemone sub-communities, or a cyclically changing patchwork of parcels within tracts of each. Treating a whole woodland in this way results in great spatial variation at any one time, though in any one section of a stand, the differences are essentially a temporal perturbation of an underlying floristic pattern related to natural variation in the soils. With neglect of coppicing, such edaphic transitions can become more obvious again, though after several decades of uninterrupted underwood growth the shape of old compartments can become marked on the ground once more by abrupt transitions to the Hedera sub-community with a dense woody cover. And many woodlands Subject to intensive use in the past still preserve complex patterns of zonations between the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland and other vegetation types which reflect the structural organisation of the site. Commonest among these are the transitions in larger rides and glades which are here often picked out by stands of Pteridium or Rubus-Holcus underscrub, frequently now invaded by birch, Crataegus monogyna and Prunus spinosa. External boundaries to stands of the community can show similar zonations, though where the woodlands survive within intensive agricultural landscapes, there is generally only a very compressed fringe of Crataegus or Prunus scrub with Rubus-Holcus underscrub or, on more free-draining soils, a narrow strip of Betula and Pteridium, with an abrupt transition to pasture or arable. In other situations, more extensive marginal transitions to herbaceous vegetation can be seen and these, together with young stands developing anew on railway verges (e.g. Sargent 1984) and on commons where grazing rights have fallen into disuse, can give some clues as to the serai development of the community. However, systematic studies of successions to the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland are very few (Salisbury 191 Sb, Adamson 1921, Tansley 1939), usually con cerned with stands developing on abandoned arable land and set within a very broad understanding of what 'oak woodland' is or ought to be. The following observations are therefore very brief and generalised. Within the lowlands, the natural limits to the development of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland are set, for the most part, by the character of the soils such that the community is excluded from situations where the substrate is markedly base-rich, base-poor or very wet. Within this fairly broad compass, it probably approximates to the climax forest type, except within the natural range of Fagus which competes successfully with Q. robur for dominance over similar field layers to those characteristic here on all but the moister brown soils on which the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland can occur (e.g. Watt 1923, 1924, 1925, 1934a, b). The natural herbaceous precursors to the community are probably very varied. Over the central type of brown earth, with free but not excessive drainage, less calcicolous types of the Arrhenatheretum axs likely to figure prominently with, on more waterlogged mesotrophic soils, communities like the Holco-Juncetum and the Holcus-Deschampsia grassland. Towards the extreme of more strongly leached soils, this kind of woodland can probably supersede the less calcifuge types of Festuca-Agrostis grassland, though it is not usually a natural successor to ericaceous heath. Where these types of vegetation are not regularly grazed, mown or burned, invasion by some of the characteristic shrubs and trees of the community can be very rapid. On moister soils, Crataegus monogyna and Prunus spinosa, Rubus fruticosus and Rosa spp. are frequent early colonisers, quickly thickening up to form a patchwork of scrub. In drier situations, Betula pendula becomes increasingly prominent in the early stages and it too may form dense thickets. In certain cases, this kind of young woodland can persist for some time: birch-dominated stands in particular seem to be more resistant https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.015 Published online by Cambridge University PressW10 Quercus robur-Pteridium aquilinum-Rubus fruticosus woodland 187 to further development than might be expected from the relatively short life of the individual trees (e.g. Rackham 1980). But it is a very common feature of this type of succession that oak, especially Q. robur, invades very early. The present poor regeneration of this tree within closed woodlands is well known (e.g. Watt 1919, Jones 1959, Rackham 1980) and probably a fairly natural consequence of a number of factors, chiefly the neglect of coppicing which created a regular sequence of large well-lit gaps, and loss of seedlings to moth caterpillars and oak mildew (e.g. Jones 1959, Shaw 1974, Rackham 1980). In the open, however, young oaks can appear quickly and in profusion. Acorns are distributed much further from the parent tree than, for example, beech mast, being carried hundreds of metres by pigeons, corvids and squirrels (Jones 1959, Mellanby 1968) and they are readily able to germinate in closed swards, even if the shade cast by tall grasses, open bracken or nearby young shrubs is moderately dense (Jones 1959). Early growth may be slow but young oaks are very resilient and there seems little doubt that in many younger stands, Q. robur has played an important role from the outset. We do not know how long it takes for Quercus -Pteridium-Rubus woodlands to acquire the richer field layers typical of the community. Young dense stands are often of the Hedera type, ivy carpets spreading even when the vegetation is in the scrub stage. And older stands derived from invasion may perhaps develop the character of the Holcus sub-community as the canopy opens and the woodland becomes more accessible to disturbance. But complete invasion by the more slow-spreading herbs probably takes centuries and, though Carpinus and Castanea may find a place in the developing woody cover in the south-east, the more diverse and complex mixtures of trees and shrubs characteristic of ancient stands are not found. Distribution "
"w11","Zonation and succession Zonations within stands of the community and between the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland and other vege tation types are most frequently related to edaphic differences and variation in grazing intensity. Often, the effects of these factors can be seen in isolation but, since lighter grazing and a tendency towards mull development can produce similar results in the field layer, it is sometimes difficult to disentangle their influence. Transitions from the Blechnum to the Dryopteris sub community, for example, may result from either of these causes; and, in some cases, they may be operating together (e.g. Tittensor & Steele 1971). Soil-related zonations here directly parallel the pat terns found among analogous woodlands in the lowland south, with transitions to more calcicolous, more calcifugous and wetter woodlands occurring commonly. On more base-rich soils, the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland typically gives way to the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland, provided the soils do not, at the same time, become very wet. Such zonations are frequent but local in the west and they often reflect a change in the https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.016 Published online by Cambridge University PressWil Quercuspetraea-Betula pubescens-0xalis acetosella woodland 207 character of the underlying rock, as where limy partings occur interbedded with shales in Silurian deposits in Wales, the Lake District and southern Scotland or in Carboniferous sequences in the Pennines, where andesite occurs within the Borrowdale Volcanics of the Lake District (Pearsall 1968, Pearsall & Pennington 1973), where Carboniferous Limestone replaces the intruded dolerite in Teesdale (Pigott 1956a, Graham 1971) and where Durness Limestone and Torridonian deposits are juxtaposed on Skye (Birks 1973). In such situations, there may be a fairly sharp switch from the Blechnum sub-community here to the Typical sub-community of the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland or, on less sharply contrasted soils and where grazing is less intense, from the Dryopteris sub-community to the Crépis sub-community of the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland. Quite often, however, changes in soil conditions are much more gradual or uneven than this, being related to quite slight differences in the calcareous character of a drift cover or bedrock or to diffuse flushing by base-rich waters. Then, particularly if the woodlands are grazed, the characteristic grasses of the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland may continue some way into the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland and more calcicolous herbs like Mercurialis perennis, Geum urbanum and Circaea lutetiana make but a sporadic appearance at first. Over more complex topographies, as in ravines, there may be a very disorderly inter-digitation of the two communities over the surface of tumbled boulders, slumped masses of soil, rock faces and fragmentary patches of alluvium along the stream-side. Changes in the canopy, too, can be slight, especially in the far northwest, where Q. petraea and Fraxinus are scarce and where both these communities have a scrubby cover in which B. pubescens and Sorbus figure prominently. In such situations, a rise in the prominence of Corylus may mark the transition but, further south, it is Fraxinus, less commonly Ulmus glabra and Acer pseudoplatanus, that increase. Where the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland gives way to the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis type along streams, these can often be picked out from afar as very distinct streaks of brighter green, a feature well caught in Pearsall (1968). In the Lake District, where such situations are quite frequent, relic stools of Tilia cordata, sometimes of immense size, can be found growing on the ravine edge which marks the boundary between the two communities (Pigott & Huntley 1978). Here, too, treatment has sometimes sharpened up the distinction between the communities, the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland of the interfluves having been used as oak coppice, the transitional zone and Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland proper of the ravine slopes hav ing been inaccessible (Pigott & Huntley 1978). The fact that flushing is often the factor responsible for base-enrichment within sites where the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland is represented, means that tran sitions of this kind often involve elements of the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland disposed over the very wettest ground with local patches of plants such as Lysimachia nemorum, Deschampsia cespitosa, Chrysosplenium oppositifolium and large sedges such as Carex remota, C. pendula or C. laevigata. On gentler slopes, this community may form fairly well defined flushes within the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland: these are very characteristic of Carboniferous and Silurian sequences where ground water emerges when it hits impervious shales. In analagous situations where less base-rich ground water emerges, the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland is replaced by soligenous Betula-Molinia woodland. Zonations to woodland of freely-drained, acidic soils with pronounced mor accumulation and/or podzolisation typically involve replacement by the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland and they can be seen throughout the range of the community wherever the influence of pervious and acidic parent materials increases and leaching can have its full effect. Sometimes, this involves a switch in the nature of the bedrock, as in moving on to Torridonian sandstones or Lewisian gneiss in north-west Scotland (e.g. Birks 1973, Ratcliffe 1977), or to more acidic strata in the Devonian Old Red Sandstone in eastern Scotland and in Silurian sequences in the Lake District, southern Scotland and Wales, to sandstones and grits in the Pennine Carboniferous or to acidic igneous rocks in the Lake District. In other cases, it is related to the thinning of a cover of colluvium or drift over such deposits or to the lessening of a flushing effect. The floristic transitions involved here can already be seen to some extent within the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland itself in the way in which the more strictly calcifugous element in the Blechnum sub-community rises to prominence as the soil cover thins to a humic cap over acidic boulders. But often the zonation continues over rankers and podzols to the Isothecium-Diplophyl-lum or Typical sub-communities of the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland in the west (Figure 21). In eastern Scotland, there are analagous transitions from the Ane mone and Stellaria-Hypericum sub-communities to the Rhytidiadelphus sub-community of the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland. Locally, in this region, more calcifugous kinds of Juniperus-0xalis woodland can replace the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland in zonations of this kind and, in both east and west Scotland, the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland is locally associated with the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland on more podzolised soils. As noted earlier, the effect of grazing on the ericoid sub-shrubs which help distinguish the field layers of https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press208 Woodlands and scrub these communities, can blur the boundaries. But grazing also mediates zonations of its own, most notably to different kinds of the Festuca-Agrostis-Gcilium grassland, which is composed of virtually the same species as the field-layer constants of the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland and which, in wetter regions, can have a number of its characteristic bryophytes. Very often, on the lower slopes of the uplands, the Festuca-Agrostis grassland runs straight into unenclosed Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland, the only changes across the junction being the appearance of trees, an increase in the cover and variety of bryophytes with the greater shelter and a patchy dominance of Hyacinthoides or Anemone in the spring. In more inaccessible spots within such woodlands, there may be some patchy regeneration of the canopy but there is no doubt that such zonations often represent the near-final stages in the conversion of the woodland to the grassland and that the completion of the process is then attendant only on the final destruction of the trees, an event which has been only too frequent in the long history of upland grazing. Continued grazing maintains the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland as a plagioclimax and recolonisation is rarely seen but it can be observed in some extensive fenced reserves or where tracts of upland have been enclosed for commercial forestry or around lake and reservoir catchments. Around Thirlmere, in the Lake District, for example, recolonisation of open grassland has been speedy: B. pubescens, Sorbus and Corylus have established themselves in local profusion and young Q. petraea can be found growing up through the thickets (Pearsall & Pennington 1973). Such enclosures could also provide opportunities for studying uninterrupted primary invasion of bare talus, free of the disturbance which the roaming of sheep and walkers bring. We do not know what the natural precursors of the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland in such situations might be. The most likely candidates would seem to be open communities of bryophytes and ferns such as Thelypte-ris limbosperma and Blechnum spicant and, where there is a more extensive soil cover, vegetation like that of the Luzula sylvatica-Vaccinium myrtillus community. Fragments of such vegetation can often be found in more rocky situations close to the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland; and, on inaccessible ledges with seepage of fairly base-poor waters within tracts of Festuca-Agros-tis-Galium grassland, they can reproduce fairly faithfully the field layer of ungrazed Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland without a cover of trees. They also extend the distribution of this kind of herbaceous vegetation above the present tree-line in the Scottish Highlands and were considered by McVean & Ratcliffe (1962) as a tree-less facies of the community. Some of the characteristic herbs of the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland can also be found under a cover of bracken in the Pteridium aquilinum-Galium saxatile Oxalis woodland (b). With grazing, there is often a gradual transition between these two, W17c Anthoxanthum-Agrostis sub-community of the former passing imperceptibly to W11 b Blechnum sub-community of the latter (c).Figure 21. Patterns among oak-birch woodlands in relation to soils and treatment. At a grit-shale junction (a), a common pattern on ungrazed slopes is for W17b Typical Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland to give way below to W1 la Dryopteris sub-community of Quercus-Betula-https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.016 Published online by Cambridge University PressWil Quercuspetraea-Betula pubescens-0xalis acetosella woodland 209 community and stands of this vegetation type are com monly seen in close association with the woodland and Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland. A characteristic pattern is for Pteridium to be very dense and vigorous over the colluvium on the lower slopes adjacent to the wood, thinning out to a sparse cover in the grassland above. This is just the kind of distribution that bracken shows within stands of the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland but there is no doubt that, with the destruction of the woodland cover and freedom from shade, it can increase greatly in abundance. Stands of the Pteri-dium-Galium community sometimes preserve elements of the richness of the woodland flora, with a vernal carpet of Hyacinthoides or Anemone, but very often they are poor in associates and the great extension of bracken over the deeper soils of the uplands is an unfortunate side effect of the widespread destruction of the community, and a change that is difficult and costly to reverse. There have been other permanent losses to coniferous forestry. The Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland will stand canopy replacement by Fagus (e.g. Watt 1931) and a moderate amount of coniferisation, but extensive planting of softwoods (except perhaps Larix spp.) greatly increases shade and speeds mor accumulation, thus accentuating the tendency to podzolisation in the wet climate, a process which is ameliorated by the natural cover of oak and birch. Although the history of the loss of the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland by these treatments has been long and complex, with local or temporary halts and reversals related to shifts in the balance of the upland economy, its decline has been progressive and very widespread. It seems to represent the climax type of oak birch forest on less markedly leached soils in the northwest but now survives as fragments within its potential range, usually much affected by grazing and in land scapes devoted primarily to pastoral agriculture and commercial forestry. In one area, however, it is proportionately more prominent than might be expected and that is in east-central Scotland. Here, McVean & Rat cliffe (1962) proposed that pine-dominance was the more natural development in post-Glacial forests, a suggestion largely borne out by subsequent palynological studies (e.g. Birks 1970, Gunson 1975, O’Sullivan 1977). In fact, the tree cover of the original pine forest in this region seems to have been more diverse and intimately mixed than in surviving stands of the Pinus-Hyloco-mium woodland, such that both pine and birch probably occurred together over more acidic soils. With clearance, burning and grazing, birch has increased its rela tive prominence in this region, now holding sway in both the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland on podzols and in the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland on less strongly leached profiles in sites where Pinus sylvestris was once much better represented.Distribution "
"w12","Zonation and succession Zonation within individual stands of Fagus-Mercurialis woodland are generally related to edaphic differences, upon which are superimposed variations related to canopy shade, regeneration and treatment, a pattern very well illustrated in the Cotswold woodlands studied by Barkham & Norris (1967, 1970). In fact, though the sub-communities can be clearly defined in relation to soil differences, transitional stands are very common because of the fairly gentle character of many slopes over the southern limestones and the frequently con torted fronts of their scarps. Generally speaking, how ever, within individual woodlands which cover a fair range of topographic variation, the trend is for the Mercurialis sub-community to give way to the Sanicula sub-community over steeper, more exposed slopes with shallower, drier soils, with the Taxus sub-community making a more local appearance over the steepest, rockiest ground with high exposure to wind and sun. Very locally, as on Box Hill, in Surrey, the transition continues into Taxus woodland proper with a thick undercanopy of Buxus. Many stands of the community now remain as rem nant strips of woodland isolated on the more intractable ground of scarps by the conversion of the dip slope above and the vale beneath to intensive agriculture. But in some places, the Fagus-Mercurialis woodland may run on some way over the dip slope as the Mercurialis sub-community on brown rendzinas or brown calcarhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press228 Woodlands and scrub eous earths derived from but thin covers of superficials: this pattern seems most characteristic of the South Downs where fairly base-rich soils are quite extensive on the dip. Often, though, where there is continuity of woodland cover, there is an edaphically-related transition to the Fagus-Rubus woodland on deeper, more base-poor and patchily-gleyed brown earths formed from substantial thicknesses of superficials like Clay-with-Flints. Such zonations can be gradual but, where they are sharp, they can be very striking, with an abrupt termination of Mercwràz/zs-dominance and a switch to thick tangles of Rubus, and a replacement of the poor Fagus of the scarp by magnificent trees on the dip. Intensive farming and forestry of limestone slopes in the south-east, with conversion of the vegetation to improved pasture, arable or plantations, has severely restricted gradual transitions from the Fagus-Mercurialis woodland to more natural kinds of herbaceous communities, so that stands are now abruptly defined by artificial boundaries or have, at most, a very narrow fringe of marginal scrub and rank grassland. But, in larger gaps within existing woodlands, and where there is more long-lasting neglect of the surrounding land, fragmentary zonations can be seen which give some clue as to the serai development of this kind of woodland: these were the sorts of situations from which Watt (1924, 1934a) accumulated the data for his hypothesis on succession to beech-domination over more base-rich soils. Although Watt's proposals were based on observation of spatial patterns rather than monitoring through time and undertaken when a combination of severe agricultural depression and good masting in Fagus (in 1922) tended to maximise colonisation, his theory still provides a convincing account of how the Fagus-Mercurialis woodland can develop and how the major floristic differences within it are prefigured in the scrub, and perhaps also in the grassland, that precede it. Although Watt recognised a continuous range of variation between both the two major types of mature Fagus-Mercurialis woodland, the Sanicula and Mercurialis sub-communities, and their serai precursors, he defined two extreme lines of succession, the 'Juniper sere' and the 'Hawthorn sere' (termed the 'Juniper-Sanicle sere' and the 'Hawthorn-Mercury sere' by Tansley 1939). In both, a calcicolous scrub was the first major development in pasture where grazing was neglected. Qualitatively, little difference was to be perceived within this vegetation but there was some quantitative polarisation in the frequency and abundance of certain shrubs and trees according to soil conditions. On the more drought-prone, shallower soils developed on steeper slopes in exposed situations, Juniperus communis was especially frequent, often abundant and quite vigorous, with a slightly better representation, too, of Taxus, Ilex and lianes. On deeper, moister soils over gentler slopes with some measure of shelter, Crataegus was usually the dominant and, provided rabbit-grazing did not give it an advantage over Crataegus, Juniperus was not so prominent, being susceptible to shading. There was thus, early on in the succession, the same exclusion, in the one direction, by edaphic limitation and, in the other, by competition, as could be seen in the mature woodlands in the relationship between Mercurialis and Sanicula. Fagus was found to invade both types of scrub though, even with abundant mast, colonisation was slow because of the frequent remoteness of seed-parents along the upper scarp slopes and the relative scarcity of denser patches of scrub to afford protection against rabbit-grazing. However, although the greater resis tance of Juniperus to rabbit attack might have been expected to allow Fagus to thrive better there, it in fact colonised more extensively on the moister soils favoured by Crataegus: among the Juniperus scrub, there was a characteristically local pattern of dense young Fagus clumps; among the Crataegus, a more diffuse invasion over more extended areas of ground. More importantly in the short term, the moister soils also favoured a prominence of Fraxinus which, though eventually outgrown by the Fagus, could come to dominate in a temporary 'ash consocies' interposed between scrub and the mature 'beech consociation', and survive more frequently in the woodland derived from the 'Hawthorn sere' than from the 'Juniper sere’. In the end, however, both lines of succession terminated with the inexorable dominance of Fagus, though the different kinds of 'mercury' and 'sanicle' field layer preserved the important edaphic contrast that had been of major importance throughout. In fact, in the relatively dry climate of the Chilterns, Watt's (1934a) 'ash consocies' was relatively rare but, on the moister South Downs, his earlier work (Watt 1924) and the initial survey by Adamson (1921) showed that woodlands dominated by Fraxinus or mixtures of Fraxinus and Quercus robur (termed 'ash-oak associes'), were of extensive and perhaps quite long-lasting occurrence, on ground which they presumed would eventually carry Fagus-Mercurialis woodland (Watt 1934Z>). As des cribed earlier, large gaps or clear-felled areas within stands of the community can also carry this kind of vegetation, classified in this scheme as Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland, for long periods before Fagus is able to reassert its dominance. Watt (1924) did demonstrate that Fagus was able to invade mature stands of this community (an interesting observation in the light of the supposed confinement of the tree in prehistoric forests) but this may be a very haphazard process. There may be some quite subtle edaphic limitations to its expansion, especially on transitional soils which tend to favour either Fraxinus or Q. robur (e.g. Watt 19346) and some general climatic restrictions on its spread but, as https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.017 Published online by Cambridge University PressW12 Fagus sylvatica-Mercurialis perennis woodland 229 Rackham (1980) succinctly puts it, Fagus is much more sensitive to weather than to climate and we may have to concede that its local, as well as its regional, prominence and thus the balance between Fagus-Mercurialis and Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodlands in any particular area, are partly the result of coincidences of good fruiting and human disturbance, the details of which are frequently irrecoverable. On the most extreme kinds of rendzina, where Fraxinus is very unlikely to gain any prominence in the developing woodland, it seems as if the main rival to Fagus is Taxus. No evidence is available to reveal the successional origin of the Taxus sub-community here but, edaphically, it can be seen as an extreme form of the Sanicula sub-community and, in the light of Watt's (1926) study of Taxus woodlands proper, it seems possible that it develops where Taxus gains early prominence in Juniper «^-dominated scrub and where invasion by Fagus is not entirely excluded but where its growth is locally very restricted on extremely shallow and impoverished soils on steep, sun-baked slopes. Distribution "
"w13","Zonation and succession Typically, the Taxus woodland is found in close association with grasslands and scrub which reflect grazingrelaxation over the south-eastern Chalk. Thus, stands can be found in mosaics and zonations with a complete sequence of vegetation types from close-cropped turf of the Festuca-Avenula grassland, rank swards dominated to varying degrees by coarse grasses such as Bromus erectus, Brachypodium pinnatum, Avenula pubescens, Festuca rubra and Arrhenatherum elatius, and various kinds of Crataegus-Hedera scrub. Where rabbit-infestation has become important again, patches of Festuca-Hieracium-Thymus grassland or stands of Urtica dioica may also occur. The exact disposition of these communities, their proportions and the age structure of the Taxus woodland can reflect long and complex histories of grazing by stock and wild herbivores. Much of this information is now irrecoverable though, as Williamson (1978) has shown at Kingley Vale, the effects of recent particular events can often be revealed by careful observation. It was from a consideration of spatial patterns in a number of sites in the South Downs that Watt (1926) proposed his scheme for the general serai development of the Taxus woodland. From the varied examples of Taxus invasion, Watt characterised two main trends in succession associated with the proportional importance in the protective scrub of Juniperus and Crataegus. Where the former predominated, as on shallower soils in more exposed sites, its greater resistance to browsing allowed Taxus to gain a more extensive and rapid hold; among Crataegus, invasion was slower and more dif fuse. On the deeper and somewhat moister soils typical of Crataegus scrub, Fraxinus also became increasingly important so that, in the more gradual progress to a closed Taxus const , an intermediate stage of 'yew-ash wood' supervened. Eventually, however, Taxus exerted its overwhelming dominance throughout, often leaving just either dead juniper nurses beneath or occasional emergent ash to give any clue as to the particular origin of a stand. As Watt went on to demonstrate (Watt 1934a, b), exactly the same kinds of serai development are characteristic of succession to the Fagus-Mercurialis woodland, though in that community the generally richer survival of different field layers in mature stands provides a lasting indication of the scrubby precursors and the edaphic conditions which they favour. But the great similarity of the successions does raise the question of why Fagus should invade and triumph in some situations and Taxus in others. The answer probably lies in the greater tolerance of Taxus of drier, more exposed conditions but, in many marginal cases, the success of the latter may be due to its more reliable fruiting and better seed-dispersal. Even so, Tax ws-dominance of the kind seen here is a very local phenomenon. Like Fagus, it seems to have shown a late post-Glacial spread in Britain (Firbas 1949, Godwin 1975) but it has been nowhere near as successful in establishing itself as a widespread canopy component. Once developed, however, the Taxus woodland is a climax community which cannot naturally be replaced by Fagus, or any other canopy dominant tolerant of base-rich soils, without death of the yews or felling. Some existing stands contain very old trees, though probably not as old as Watt (1962) thought: 500 years, rather than 1000, seems to be a more accurate estimate for the most ancient individuals at Kingley Vale (New-bould 1960, Williamson 1978). Stands of the community may, of course, have been in occupation in such sites for much longer, though, as Watt (1926) showed, the Taxus woodland tends to show small-scale migrations around Chalk coombes, colonising first in the head, then along the flanks and eventually, after many generations, dying from behind and invading again. In many sites, afforestation of surrounding plateau and slopes with mixtures of Fagus and conifers has isolated stands of the community, reduced their room for manoeuvre and destroyed their grand landscape context. Distribution "
"w14","Zonation and succession Zonations from the Fagus-Rubus woodland to other vegetation types most commonly reflect edaphic differences or represent stages in serai successions, though both of these kinds of transition are much affected by sylvicultural treatments and grazing or by the isolation of stands within predominantly agricultural landscapes. Some of the most intact edaphic zonations are to be seen on the Chilterns. Here, though the stands of beech are of diverse origin and have canopy structures derived by manipulations pursued, in large measure, independently of soil variation, the Fagus-Rubus woodland can still be seen in direct continuity with Fagus-Mercurialis woodland on the one hand and Fagus-Deschampsia woodland on the other, disposed in the soil-related sequence given classic expression by Watt (19346: see also Brown 1953 and Avery 1958). Incomplete sequences, lacking the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland, occur on the South Downs (e.g. Adamson 1921, Watt 1924), and the more calcifuge end of the series can be seen in the Weald and the New Forest. The sharpness of the transitions between the different kinds of beech-dominated woodlands is very variable. Zonations from the Fagus-Rubus woodland to the Fagus-Mercurialis woodland can be very striking, with an abrupt switch from a vigorous bramble underscrub on the plateau brown earth to a luxuriant carpet of Mercurialis on the scarp rendzina. But, where there is some downwash of Clay-with-Flints over the scarp brow or deposition of decalcified head in shallow valleys, the junction between the communities may be ill defined and not so clearly coincident with topography. And plateau superficials may themselves be more calcareous so that the Fagus-Mercurialis woodland extends some way on to the typical Fagus-Rubus site-type, a feature especially widespread on the South Downs. Transitions from the Fagus-Rubus to the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland are often less sharp, partly because the plateau superficials from which their soils are often derived are very variable in composition. In some localities on the Chilterns (e.g. Watt 19346), the zonation relates clearly to increasing depth of superficials with increasing distance from the scarp edge, Rubus underscrub and the more mesophytic grasses passing in well-ordered fashion to Deschampsia flexuosa, Calluna and calcifuge bryophytes. But local sandy patches and exposed brows swept clear of loose litter by wind (e.g. Avery 1958) may show unexpected transitions to the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland and there may be local development of mor beneath dense plateau beech so that mosaics of the two communities develop. Throughout these zonations, long and intensive exploitation for beech often makes canopy distinctions between the different communities very much less obvious than those of the field layer. Even in more natural circumstances, of course, Fagus is an over whelming dominant in each but changes in woody associates can sometimes also be seen. In mature stands, Fraxinus, Acerpseudoplatanus and Sorbus aria appear in the canopy more frequently with the move to the Fagus-Mercurialis woodland and Ilex is often replaced by Corylus as the leading smaller companion. In the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland, the differences are much less: both Q. robur and Ilex remain common but there is sometimes more Betula pendula and, less often, a little Q. petraea. More recently, treatments have fragmented larger stretches of these beech-dominated sequences, interposing stands with some pine and larch or plantations composed entirely of conifers. The more recent kinds of landscape with beech are well illustrated for the Chilterns by Figure 68 in Tansley (1939) and for the New Forest by the map in Tubbs (1968). The other common kind of woodland zonation involving the community, that to the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, is more complex. Sometimes this, too, is related to soil differences: there seems little doubt that, within the natural range of beech, that kind of woodland is an edaphic replacement for Fagus-Rubus woodland on strongly-gleyed soils (e.g. Watt 19346, Noirfalise 1968), and such transitions form part of the variation in the proportions of Fagus and Q. robur in the Weald, on the Chiltern plateau and in the New Forest. But complex mosaics are frequent because of fine differences in drainage impedence on gently-undulating sur faces (especially where the soils derive from superficials), and the situation is complicated by the fact that the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland seems to be a serai precursor to the Fagus-Rubus woodland. Thus, where neglected farmland or heathland on moderately base-poor soils is being colonised, or where Fagus-Rubus woodland has been felled and the site abandoned, or where large gaps develop within it, there is an initial, sometimes lengthy, period of oak-dominance before beech wins through (Watt 1924, 19346, Tansley 1939, Peterken & Tubbs 1965). Similarly, where Fagus-Rubus woodlands have been coppiced, they may have an underwood and sapling population more like that of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland (Adamson 1921). That Fagus can effect the conversion seems undeniable from the careful studies of Watt (1924,19346); that it is a precarious and sometimes very protracted process is also clear (e.g. Watt 1923, 1925, 19346, Peterken & Tubbs 1965, Rackham 1980). The ultimate precursors to the eventual development of the Fagus-Rubus woodland are probably the less https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.019 Published online by Cambridge University Press248 Woodlands and scrub calcicolous kinds of mesotrophic sward (various sub communities of the Arrhenatheretum and neglected meadows and pastures of the Centaureo-Cynosuretum and the Lolio-Cynosuretum) and the less extreme kinds of calcifuge sward in the Festuca-Agrostis grasslands and perhaps also, around the New Forest, the grassier types of Ulex minor-Agrostis curtisii heath. More open stands of Pteridium may also be colonised. Spinose shrubs are important invaders of all these communities, typically forming patchy Crataegus-Hedera scrub with a marginal tangle of Rubus-Holcus underscrub (e.g. Tansley 1922, Tansley & Adamson 1925, Watt 1924,19346). On more free-draining soils, Ulex europaeus may figure prominently in these early stages. Quite commonly, however, Q. robur and Ilex invade early and, if there is a seed source close by, Fagus itself. How long it takes for open herbaceous vegetation to progress fully to Fagus-Rubus woodland is unknown, but beech high forest of this type has clearly grown up in the New Forest within the last 300 years or so (Peterken & Tubbs 1965) and on the Chilterns in perhaps 200 years (Watt 19346). Active development is now rare: stands are often embedded within commercial forests with much coniferisation or are sharply marked off from intensive arable land; where they remain unenclosed, as in the New Forest, heavy grazing prevents expansion. Finally, there remains the possibility that the three kinds of beech forest in Britain are themselves related in a serai sequence, the Fagus-Rubus woodland developing from the Fagus-Mercurialis woodland and progressing to the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland, the process being assisted by the dominance of beech itself. Duchaufour (1950) has proposed that the establishment of a beech cover plays some part in the evolution of rendzinas to brown earths on the Lorraine Jurassic limestones but, in the Chilterns, Avery (1958) could adduce little evidence for progression beyond calcareous lithomorphic soils on drift-free Chalk, more acidic profiles being primarily related to the presence of superficials and largely inde pendent of whether there was a cover of beech woodland. Over calcareous drift, matters are not quite so clear. Here, brown calcareous soils (which typically carry the Fagus-Mercurialis woodland) and brown earths (usually with the Fagus-Rubus woodland) may well represent successive stages of leaching and suggest a succession of one community by the other. Certainly, the floristic boundary between these two woodlands can be very indistinct but this is much affected by differences in the superficials and topography (Avery 1958): again, such pedogenic variation also occurs outside beech forests, notably between calcicolous and calcifuge grasslands on limestone brows. Development of the Fagus-Rubus woodland to the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland is likewise unattested. Mor accummulation and the development of micropodzols certainly occur under beech in the Fagus-Rubus woodland, both in the Chilterns (Watt 19346, Brown 1953, Avery 1958) and the New Forest (Dimbleby & Gill 1955, Tubbs 1968) but, once more, variation in parent materials and topography play a part and a beech canopy is not a necessary pre-requisite: even when Fagus is present, how it is treated may be very important (Avery 1958). On balance, podzolisation under the Fagus-Rubus woodland does not seem to be widespread or progressive. Distribution "
"w15","Zonation and succession Two kinds of zonation are commonly found within stands of the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland. The first relates to differences in canopy shade and it can be a direct reflection of the maturation of the vegetation, with the Calluna sub-community occupying recently-colonised ground, the Fagus sub-community forming dense woodland in the establishment phase, the Des champsia or Vaccinium sub-community occurring where the canopy has begun to open up a little and the Calluna sub-community marking gaps. In fact, actively-colonising Fagus-Deschampsia woodlands are of rather res tricted occurrence and, in commercial forests, natural gap formation is pre-empted, re-establishment is from planted stock and the resultant stands have trees of uniform age with a more homogeneous field layer. Here, then, the patterning of the different sub-communities is much more regular in both space and time with sharply-defined compartments of the Fagus sub-community before thinning, the Deschampsia or Vaccinium sub community after, and the Calluna sub-community making only a brief appearance between rotations apart from along the edges of rides where it may mark a transition to a narrow strip of heath or bracken without trees. Characteristically, the outer margins of such treated stands are sharply defined with an abrupt switch to other types of forest (often conifer-dominated stands of the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland) or to surrounding agricultural land. The other kind of zonation relates to the intensity of grazing or browsing. Sometimes differences in the pres ent pattern of access by herbivores can be seen in a change from the Deschampsia to the Vaccinium sub community at an artificial stock-and deer-proof boundary; in other cases, the structure of the vegetation itself may hinder access, creating protected enclaves (as in some stands surrounded by a ring of holly, a feature in parts of the New Forest: Tubbs 1968) or a diffuse mosaic of more-and less-grazed areas with these two sub communities. Such patterns can be found in some ancient Forests and parks and they often also involve more open glades with the Calluna sub-community and stretches of heath where the establishment of a woody cover is held in check by the herbivores. Withdrawal of grazing in such situations (and the cessation of burning or the cutting of heather and bracken, once important on commons in the south) may allow more gradual zonations to develop in which light penetration through the canopy becomes the primary factor in determining the distribution of the sub-communities. In fact, woodpasture landscapes usually present complex patchworks of the various kinds of Fagus-Deschampsia woodland related to the interplay of grazing and shading, both at the present time and in the past, as Peterken & Tubbs (1965) showed in the New Forest. Mosaics of this kind, developed over fairly uniform podzolised soils, also frequently involve tracts of woodland in which beech is so poorly represented in proportion to oak and birch that the vegetation is best con sidered part of the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland. The relative ease with which these trees out perform beech in the early colonisation of open ground means that this community often functions as a serai precursor to the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland, interposed between calcifugous grassland, heath and bracken on the one hand and mature beech forest on the other, both in time and in spatial zonations. The Quer-cus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland can also be a tem porary replacement for the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland in larger gaps and clearings, before beech re establishes by seeding in around the margins or is planted in; and, where Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland seems more permanently ensconced, there is sometimes an assumption that it occupies ground that, had it not suffered gross disturbance, would naturally carry Fagus-Deschampsia woodland (e.g. Géhu 1975«). In fact, even within the native range of beech in Britain, this tree is rather slow to assert or reassert its dominance in these situations: on newly-colonised ground, the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland often seems to attain a stability of its own; and, even when beech is abundant in the immediate neighbourhood, it has some difficulty in getting away in larger gaps. It may therefore be too simplistic to regard the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland as the natural climax forest on more surface-leached soils in southern Britain: if anything, it is beech, with its unreliable fruiting and poor seed-dispersal, which requires a measure of assistance to succeed, a fact borne in on practitioners of the selection system of treatment (Brown 1953, 1964), and one invoked to explain the tardy and limited migration of this tree in the post-Glacial period in Britain (e.g. Godwin 1975). And, even where beech has become well established on such profiles, it may be more accurate to see its dominance as under a measure of threat from oak and birch, such that slowly-shifting patchworks of Fagus-Deschampsia and Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodlands are a quite natural feature, moved towards the former community by selection for beech, in favour of the latter wherever there is opportunity for expansion of the forest cover. There may also be room for some reassessment of the status of the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland in relation to its counterpart on less base-poor brown earths, the Fagus-Rubus woodland. In general, the floristic distinchttps://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.020 Published online by Cambridge University Press258 Woodlands and scrub tions between these two communities are better defined than those between the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland and its oak-birch analogue, having a firm foundation in edaphic differences. Transitions from the one community to the other can sometimes be observed within individual stands, beech-dominance being maintained throughout, but the field and ground layers showing a marked change with the switch from leached brown earths with mull to podzols with mor, a zonation forming part of the soil-vegetation series described from the Chilterns (Watt 19346, Avery 1958) but also seen in more complex mosaics in the New Forest (Tubbs 1968). As noted earlier, however, small-scale variation in topography and parent materials may make this kind of transition quite ill defined, so that again patchworks of the two communities are a fairly normal feature. It is also possible that, in more marginal situations, there is some measure of cyclical alternation in time between the Fagus-Deschampsia and Fagus-Rubus woodlands at any one place. Despite the fact that beech can encourage the formation of mor and thus favour the development of soil conditions inimical to the survival of some of its characteristic associates in the Fagus-Rubus woodland, this is not necessarily a progressive and irreversible process, indeed it seems to be best favoured by certain treatments of beech, rather than being a wholly natural development (Avery 1958). And, once again, it may be that, in less strictly-treated high forest, oak and birch play an important part here because with Rubus underscrub, they can pre-empt beech in gaps, allow the spread of a more extensive field layer in their less dense shade and perhaps shift the edaphic and vegetational balance back to less extreme conditions. Along both its boundaries with other woodland types, the soil-related junction with the Fagus-Rubus woodland and the competi-tive/successional one with the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, the relationships of the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland are thus more complex than they seem at first sight. Distribution "
"w16","Zonation and succession Zonations from this community to other kinds of woodland are most frequently related to differences in soils. Quite often, these are complicated by the effects of sylvicultural treatments and the impact of larger herbivores, but grazing and browsing also mediate other kinds of transitions to grassland and heath which are a spatial expression of succession or its reversal. Burning is also a factor in these latter kinds of zonations. Although neglect of heathland exploitation has allowed extensive development of progressive successional change in some areas, many stands have artificially sharp boundaries with adjacent land converted to agri cultural use. Edaphically-related transitions usually reflect changes to soil parent materials that are not so markedly acidic or pervious (commonly both) as those which typically weather to the humic rankers and podzolised profiles characteristic here. Such changes are very common within whole woods in which this community is represented and they most often result in zonations to the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, the forest type of base-poor brown earths, frequently with some drainage-impedence, in the British lowlands. Boundaries between the two communities are not always very sharp, especially where superficials provide the underlying substrate. Fluvioglacial deposits, for example, and aeolian material are commonly very heterogeneous, even over short distances, and, in parts of the Midlands, in Suffolk and Essex and in some areas of the New Forest, small-scale variation in the proportions of sand, silt and clay may be sufficient to produce mosaics of brown earths or brown sands and podzols which bear patchworks of these two kinds of woodlands, in these regions usually the Typical sub-community of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland and the Quercus sub community of the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland. The distribution of more mesophytic species characteristic of the former and the calcifuge herbs of the latter often provides a firm diagnosis of the components but, by mid-summer, when the vernal dominance of Hyacinthoides has faded from the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland and a dense canopy of bracken extends throughout, the distinctions may be masked. Uniform treatment as wood-pasture, which can eliminate most of the understorey, and pollarding throughout, can cause further confusion. Oak coppice sometimes extends over such boundaries, though the post-coppice floras in actively-treated stands of each of the two communities can indicate the underlying soil differences afresh. Cop picing for hazel, largely confined to the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, may actually highlight the transition. Where these kinds of soil differences are related to changes in sedimentary rocks, the zonation between the two kinds of woodland can be a much sharper one. Interbedded clays are a characteristic feature among the Cretaceous sands and sandstones of the Weald and they occur, too, within the Eocene sequences of Essex and the New Forest. Similar alternations are found further north in the Triassic deposits of the Midlands. All of these can carry bands of the Quercus sub-community of the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland and the Typical sub-community of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, the former usually above the latter on the more resistant topography of the arenaceous rocks, giving way below to the more weathered argillaceous slopes. On the Pennine fringes this kind of geological and topographic contrast, reflected in the soils and woodland cover, is even more striking with Carboniferous sandstones and grits forming cliffs and screes with the Vaccinium-Dryopteris sub-community, giving way below to the Acer-Oxalis sub-community of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland on shales. Edaphic var iation over the extensive and varied grit exposures may also here introduce much more field-layer variation into the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland than is usual over the gentler topography of the southern lowlands. Quite a common complication, too, is for landslips to occur where incompetent shales collapse and spill down great blocks of the overlying grits on to the lower slopes: then perched fragments of the calcifuge flora of the community may occur among a ground of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, a striking sight in spring when a carpet of bluebells runs up between them. Very often, on shedding slopes, these junctions between arenaceous and argillaceous sedimentaries are marked by flushing, as ground waters percolating through the sands, sandstones or grits hit the impervious clays or shales and emerge in springs or seepage lines. Then the transition from the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland to the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland can have some kind of interposed flush woodland, frequently of small extent, though often occurring repeatedly along the geological boundary. Where the flush waters are not too base-poor, the Carex-Cirsium sub-community of the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland is typical in such situations, being a common feature in the western Weald and along Pennine valley sides; where they are more acid, frequently the case to the north where they drain from expanses of moorland, the Juncus sub-community of the Betula-Molinia woodland replaces it in analogous topographic situations. https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.021 Published online by Cambridge University Press272 Woodlands and scrub Where flush waters emerge at such geological junctions within more level-bedded rocks and maintain the soils over the clays and shales in a more permanently waterlogged state, some surface peat may accumulate. Then, these kinds of flush woodland are replaced by their topogenous equivalents, the Carex-Alnus woodland in more base-rich sites (usually the Chrysosplenium sub-community), the Sphagnum sub-community of the Betula-Molinia woodland in the more base-poor. Often, the stands of these kinds of wet woodland are more extensive than their flush counterparts, sometimes wholly replacing the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland in its position below the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland. Again, the western Weald and the Pennine fringes have good examples of this kind of pattern. The other very common kind of zonation in which this woodland can be found involves transitions to heaths, or to complexes of heath with calcifugous grasslands and stands of bracken. The type of heath occurring in association with the community varies considerably according to the region: over the range of the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland, heaths show wide phytogeographic differences. In East Anglia and down into parts of the Weald, the Calluna-Festuca heath is typical, then from there westwards the Calluna-Ulex minor and Ulex minor-Agrostis curtisii heaths and, in the north Midlands, the Calluna-Ulex gallii heath. In the Pennines, the Calluna-Deschampsia and Calluna-Vaccinium heaths are the usual companions. Sometimes the zonations from woodland to heath are well ordered and have some clear basis in topographic and edaphic variation, as where tree cover becomes very sparse over fragmentary humic rankers on grit boulders or cliffs in the Pennines (e.g. Moss 1913, Pigott 1956/>), but very often such patterns are more complex and independent of substrates and soils. Frequently, here, fragments of heath occur within stretches of the woodland, confined to gaps or forming larger areas in the kind of landscape seen in some ancient wood-pastures (e.g. Hopkinson 1927, Mackney 1961, Rackham 1980, Peterken 1981), or stands of the woodland are distributed among extensive tracts of heath, as on the Wealden and Surrey commons and in parts of the New Forest (e.g. Tansley 1939, Wooldridge & Goldring 1953). And in such situations, it is usually abundantly clear that the zonations are an expression of serai progression to woodland or its reconversion to heath as a result of a variety of biotic activities. Thus, heath sub-shrubs and Pteridium form the characteristic gap or coppice flora here, developing where trees fall or are extracted or cut as underwood. And these plants can spread at the expense of a tree cover in the immediate aftermath of destruction of the community by fire. Grazing and browsing may work more slowly, though to the same ultimate end: a very open canopy of trees can persist in wood-pasture stands of the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland for cen turies, but with no hope of unaided regeneration if access to herbivores is maintained, a situation seen only too well in some old Forests and parks (Peterken & Tubbs 1965, Rackham 1980, Peterken 1981). Where the community has declined in extent or vigour, then, or where its expansion has been checked, it is these factors, working separately or often in complex combinations (e.g. Peterken & Tubbs 1965, Peterken 1969, 1981, Rackham 1980), that seem generally to blame, rather than any natural demise in the face of extreme edaphic conditions (cf. Tansley 1911, 1939) or a harsh climate (Pigott 1983). Moreover, the ability of the community to regenerate and colonise new ground has been observed with striking clarity wherever and whenever the inci dence of these factors has declined, the neglect of the exploitation of heathy commons being especially important in the recent extensive spread of this kind of woodland in the south-east. However, though the community seems to be a quite natural development from heaths at the present time, two questions arise over its status. The first is of longterm historical interest and concerns the possibility that, in many areas, heath vegetation has prepared the ground for the spread of the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland by enhancing podzolisation on land that was previously of higher fertility and perhaps bore more mesophytic forest but which was progressively exhausted by early agricultural activity (e.g. Dimbleby & Gill 1955, Dimbleby 1962, Gimingham 1972). This may well have been the case in some places but whether it has everywhere been a necessary precondition is another matter. The community can certainly maintain podzols in a stable state (Mackney 1961, Pigott 1983) and oak-birch forest of this kind may itself be able to promote podzolisation (Scheys et al. 1954, Munault 1959). The second issue concerns the stability of the community in relation to its beech-dominated analogue, the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland, in particular the competitive ability of oak and beech on the markedly dry, acid soils characteristic of both communities. On moister soils of low base-status, Fagus is at some disadvantage against Q. robur (Watt 1924, 1934Z?), so the distinction between the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus and the Fagus-Rubus woodlands often has a clear edaphic basis in semi-natural woods within the natural range of beech. Here, oak and beech are more closely matched in their potential ability to dominate, each is found in stands where the other is pre-eminent and, in those areas where both communities are well represented, as in the New Forest (Peterken & Tubbs 1965, Tubbs 1968) and parts of the Chilterns (Watt 1934Z>, Avery 1958), inti https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.021 Published online by Cambridge University PressW16 Quercus spp.-Betula spp.-Deschampsia flexuosa woodland 273 mate mosaics of the two are common. A number of factors are probably important in determining which species will come to prevail. First, though Fagus grows well way beyond its natural limit to the north, there may be some climatic restriction on its vigour towards the drier parts of East Anglia (Rackham 1980). Second, outside this area, Fagus is still a very erratic fruiter and oak, certainly Q. robur, though itself not very consistent in acorn production, has the advantage that its fruits can be transported over considerable distances, whereas beech mast generally drops straight down off the parent (Watt 1924, Jones 1959, Mellanby 1968). In larger gaps, therefore, and on previously open ground, colonisation by oak, as against beech, is more widespread and more regular, though grazing and browsing, which favour the latter, can offset this (Dengler 1930, Jones 1959). Third, under closed canopies, the advantage moves in the other direction (provided adult beech is present and has produced mast) because Q. robur regenerates badly under established woodland and beech seedlings and saplings are more shade-tolerant than those of Q. petraea. Here, then, beech may triumph eventually (Watt 1924, 19346), even well outside its range (Pigott 1983). The outcome of such conflicting factors may, in many places and at any given time, be a fairly even match so that the dominants, and their communities, form a mosaic, each coming and going, here and there, in a complex pattern of regenerative replacement. On the Continent, the consensus of opinion is that the equivalents of the Fagus-Deschampsia woodland represent the climax on the kinds of soil characteristic here, the counterparts of the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland, their serai precursors or degraded derivatives (e.g. Géhu 1 975 æ) and, given ideal conditions for beech, this may well be the situation here. Often, however, con ditions are not ideal so that the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland, though theoretically a sub-climax, attains a considerable measure of stability. The other tree species which frequently complicates successions to this community is Pinus sylvestris which is widely distributed as an ornamental in this kind of woodland and extensively planted on lowland podzols. It fruits heavily, has light wind-dispersed seeds and does especially well, with birch, as a coloniser of open ground after fires have cleared a cover of bracken and heath (e.g. Tubbs 1968). Where its canopy remains open or where it is present in mixed covers of trees, the vegetation can retain the general character of the community but densely-shaded stands of pine quickly eliminate vir tually all the field-layer species and bryophytes. The same poverty is characteristic of plantations of P. sylvestris and other conifers on the soils typical here, though thinning may restore some of the richness of the vege tation (such as it is). Often, now, in intensively afforested areas, the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland is reduced to a fringe of birch, bracken and ericoids along the edges of rides and on recently-cleared compartments. The generally poor quality of the soils under the community means that conversion of this kind of woodland to intensive agricultural land is exceptional. Quite commonly, stands have been reduced to isolated rem nants but they usually persist, outside the heathland or wood-pasture context, in pastoral landscapes, marked off sharply from some kind of improved grassland, either various types of Festuca-Agrostis sward or more calcifugous sub-communities of mesotrophic grassland. Narrow strips of bracken, ericoids or Ulex spp. may occur as a compressed fringe around the woodland. Distribution "
"w17","Zonation and succession Zonations between the different types of Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland and from this community to other vegetation types are most commonly related to differences in microclimate, topography and soils and grazing and, as explained above, all these factors can interact in complex fashion, often in an inter-dependent way, so it is quite rare to find simply-explicable transitions. The edaphic trend within the community is essentially one of soil maturity, running from lithomorphic rankers, such as are typical of the Isothecium-Diplophyllum sub-community, to the deeper, more stable and mature brown podzolic soils and podzols characteristic of the other sub-communities. To the west, such a trend is often visible in terms of a zonation from the former over the rocky ground of crags and screes to either the Typical sub-community (in less heavily grazed woods) or the Anthoxanthum-Agrostis sub-community (in hea vily-grazed woods) on downwash soils over the gentler slopes below. And, on a smaller scale, the pattern may be repeated over the variably-sloping surfaces of every large boulder in differences in the stability and composition of the bryophyte mat. Between the two zones, there can be very complex mosaics as stretches of deeper soil run up between boulders and become fragmented https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.022 Published online by Cambridge University Press290 Woodlands and scrub into pockets between and atop the rocks; and, in the other direction, as boulders become progressively more isolated and sunken into the body of the creep soils. And such zonations are frequently complicated by climatically-related responses in the vegetation, so that shifts towards a more southerly, sunnier aspect may increase the proportion of ground occupied by either the Typical or Anthoxanthum-Agrostis sub-communities (especially perhaps the latter as lack of cool shade may depress Vaccinium and enhance the grass cover); or, conversely, a move towards more northerly aspects may produce a greater contribution from the Isothecium-Diplophyllum sub-community. Especially complex patterns may be found in landscapes cleft by repeated ravines, where alternating zones may lie side by side along a slope and where, within each gorge, there is a small-scale and almost unfathomable jumble of vegetation disposed over cliffs, ledges, tumbled blocks and slips of soil. Quite commonly in the situations where the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland is found, edaphic zonations continue to less base-poor profiles, usually strongly-leached brown earths. Such a transition can be related to a change in the underlying bedrock from more coarsegrained arenaceous sedimentaries or igneous or metamorphic rocks to more fine-grained ones which weather to a less readily leached mantle: this kind of switch is a fairly common feature in Silurian and Ordovician sequences in Wales and the Lake District and among volcanic rocks in the Lakes and parts of Scotland (e.g. Pearsall 1968, Pearsall & Pennington 1973). In such cases, the associated edaphic and vegetational changes can be sudden and clearly marked but, very often, it is the presence of superficials, like glacial drift or head, or the effect of flushing, that shifts the direction of soil development by masking the effect of the underlying acidic rocks and then the edaphic and vegetational gradient is much more gradual and ill defined. Typically, though, in all these situations, the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland gives way, with varying degrees of sharpness, to the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland, with a decline in ericoids and more calcifugous herbs and bryophytes and an increase in Hyacinthoides, Rubus and Holcus mollis. But uniformly intense grazing over these boundaries may soften the transition and, even where there is no grazing, very much the same kind of tree canopy extends over both communities with even Cor ylus providing no sure guide as to the move from one to the other (Figure 21). The juxtaposition of highly acidic and markedly basic rocks, or the presence of very calcareous drift over siliceous substrates, or strong flushing with very baserich waters, all of which can occur locally within the range of the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland, result in a sharper shift from the community to either the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland or, in very wet situations, the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland. Then there is often a much more obvious floristic difference among all elements of the vegetation with calcicolous species replacing the calcifugous. In some areas though, extreme climatic conditions produce a convergence among certain components: this is well seen in the Suardal area of Skye where stands of all three of these communities, and of the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland on intermediate soils, occur under scrubby canopies of B. pubescens, S. aucuparia and Corylus and with a prominent western element among the bryophytes (Birks 1973). As well as confounding the simplicity of these kinds of zonations, grazing and browsing also produce transitions of their own which are essentially a reflection of the successional development of the community or, very commonly, its reversal. Burning is also frequently involved as a factor in such zonations. Serai progressions to the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland have not been followed (they are rare, of course, and now often seen only in fenced sections of reserves or in forestry or reservoir enclosures) but the most obvious natural precursors to the community are probably the Luzula sylvatica-Vaccinium myrtillus tail-herb vegetation and certain kinds of Calluna-Vaccinium heath. Both of these show considerable overlap with the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland in their edaphic and climatic requirements and essentially reproduce ele ments of its field and ground layers: McVean & Ratcliffe (1962) included stands of the Luzula-Vaccinium community as a 'treeless facies' of the woodland. Small stands of these rich vegetation types can sometimes be found in close spatial association with the community and, like it, survive as fragments within much-modified landscapes. They also extend the typical sub-shrub, herb and bryophyte cover characteristic of the community to considerably higher altitudes than those at which the woodland itself is found. In fact, much more widespread are zonations to more species-poor kinds of Calluna-Vaccinium heath (in which bryophytes in particular are ill-represented), vari ous types of calcifugous grasslands (notably less-improved Festuca-Agrostis-Galium swards) and stands of the Pteridium-Galium saxatile community, in land scapes which bear obvious signs of a long history of woodland clearance, grazing, burning and agricultural neglect. Quite often, the sequence of such vegetation types reflects the kind of underlying edaphic variation, running down from crags and screes over thin soils to colluvium, that can be seen picked out in the surviving woodland by the spatial sorting of Vaccinium myrtillus, grasses and bracken, though the proportional contribution of the last is often much greater with freedom from canopy shade on the open slopes. Fragments of the bryophyte-richness of the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland may persist in derived Calluna-Vaccinium heath, though burning is very deleterious, and, among https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.022 Published online by Cambridge University PressW17 Quercus petraea-Betula pubescens-Dicranum majus woodland 291 the sward of the plagioclimax Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland, continuous grazing and increased exposure to sun and wind can eliminate all but the more robust mosses; less intractable slopes may also have been improved by fertiliser application. Dense bracken stands, too, are usually impoverished: ericoids and herbs may persist patchily but the bryophytes are rapidly reduced by the combination of deep shade and thick litter. Finally, one very common additional element of these altered landscapes is coniferous forest which has been widely planted in the north-western uplands on soils which could otherwise support this community. Such woodlands have not been extensively sampled, though more open stands could probably be incorporated here as impoverished variants. In some parts of Scotland, there is the further problem of the relationship between the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland and what seems, from palynological evidence, to be the natural forest cover of the region, the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland (e.g. McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Birks 1970, Gunson 1975, O’Sullivan 1977). There is a considerable floristic overlap between the associated species of these two woodland types and what may have happened here, with the destruction of the original, and apparently fairly mixed, woody cover of the pine forest is that birch and oak, especially the former, have now come to dominate in the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland on the more acidic mineral soils that could naturally support pine. Distribution "
"w18","Zonation and succession The Pinus-Hylocomium woodland on Creag Fhiaclach in the Cairngorms is probably one of the very few stands of forest vegetation in Britain where trees can be seen growing at a natural, climatically-related altitudinal limit. Here, the community gives way, through a gradual loss of its pine cover, to the more calcifugous kind of Juniperus-Oxalis woodland, the characteristic montane scrub vegetation in the east-central Highlands of Scotland. Below this limit, and almost down to sea-level, the community survives as scattered stands in a number of geographical groupings, within some of which it constitutes a major element of the vegetation cover. In considering zonations, it is important to distinguish between such expanses of 'pine forest', defined on broad landscape criteria and containing a wide variety of vegetation types, including many non-wooded ones, and the stands of the different kinds of Pinus-Hylocomium woodland which form part of the mosaic. Zonations within stands of the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland, between one sub-community and another, are generally related to edaphic variation and/or the density of the tree cover. In some places, notably the Speyside and Deeside forests, transitions from the Vac cinium sub-community to the Sphagnum-Erica sub community can be seen as one moves from drier podzols to peaty podzols, a change that is often related on a broad scale to a shift to higher altitudes with their wetter climate. And, here and in the south-western forests around the Great Glen, there can be zonations from these sub-communities to the Luzula type where the soils become moderately enriched over less extreme sub strates or because of gentle flushing. Gradations from the Vaccinium or Luzula sub-communities to the Sphagnum-Erica sub-community are also typically associated with a decrease in the density of the pine canopy and the effect of this can be seen, too, over more uniformly dry soils, where the Erica-Goodyera sub-community passes to the Vaccinium sub community as the canopy thins out. Indeed, such changes can be precipitated by thinning, and, in seminatural stands, may represent a serai progression (see below). Where a general uniformity in soil conditions is maintained, continued reduction in the pine cover usually marks a gradual zonation to some kind of heath, typically various sub-communities of the Calluna-Vaccinium heath (the floristic composition of which is essentially a Pinus-Hylocomium woodland without the pine) or the Calluna-Arctostaphylos uva-ursihzatiy quite often a mosaic of both where burning patterns have been complex (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). Where the ground conditions are moister, a frequent feature among stands of the Sphagnum-Erica sub-community towards the wetter west, these dry heaths are replaced in this kind of sequence by the Scirpus-Erica wet heath, a very widespread community of thin ombrogenous peats and the fringes of valley mires in western Britain. On such wetter ground, growth of P. sylvestris is much poorer (Carlisle & Brown 1968), so the zonation is essentially an https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.023 Published online by Cambridge University PressW18 Pinus sylvestris-Hylocomium splendens woodland 309 edaphic one rather than a serai one, though drainage and fertilising has often artificially extended the range of pine on to such soils in Scotland (and, of course, elsewhere outside the natural range of the tree). Where such wet heath becomes wooded, Betula pubescens is usually the leading coloniser (often the only one) and extension of its canopy can lead to the development of stands of the Betula-Molinia woodland among the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland, a situation marked by a strong continuity in the field layer with species such as Molinia caerulea, Erica tetralix and Sphagna remaining prominent in both communities. Transitions to even wetter ground in valley and basin mires, which are quite a common feature among the complex undulating topography of fluvioglacial deposits, involve the occurrence of small stands of basepoor communities like the Carex echinata-Sphagnum or Carex rostrata-Sphagnum mires, or, where these have been colonised by trees, the Betula-Molinia or Salix-Carex woodlands. Where there is a local influence of more base-rich waters, the Pinguiculo-Caricetum and Carici-Saxifragetum mires can be found, or their wooded equivalent the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland. Within the areas where the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland is represented, all these different kinds of soil-related zonations can often be found within a relatively small compass, a feature which adds greatly to the overall diversity of the vegetation and contributes to the unique assemblage of communities which we include within the broader landscape definition of pine forest. Over the range of soil types represented within what seems to be the natural range of P. sylvestris in Britain, it is probably able to colonise and attain dominance on a fairly broad spectrum of more freely draining brown earths, brown podzolic soils and podzols and, in such situations, its natural precursors are probably the vari ous dry and wet heaths with which it can be found associated today. Where invasion has been observed, an initial slow start within the sub-shrub canopy, followed by some period of check through herbivore damage, has been succeeded by fairly rapid growth to produce vegetation resembling the Erica-Goodyera or Vaccinium sub communities or, where the initial density of seedlings was more sparse, the Sphagnum-Erica type (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). In some places, it is possible that the latter sub-community can develop from the former in a serai progression (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962), though it seems likely that there is some edaphic and climatic check on which direction succession takes: there may be two types of climax pinewood, one in the drier low-altitude eastern region, the other at higher altitudes there and in the wetter west. What does seem certain is that, in the past, progressions to pine woodland involved a greater contribution from other tree species, notably birch and juniper, which continued to be well represented in mosaics of forest, at least in the eastern Highlands of Scotland. Now, we see some greater separation in the roles which these species play. Birch-dominated calcifugous forest (often with some oak, derived in part from planted stock) of the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland, survives as dis tinct stands within the areas of pine forest and finds fragmentary representation in gaps, but it also seems to have sprung up widely on ground that mixed pine forest previously occupied. And the Juniperus-0xalis woodland, though also represented among stands of the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland, now survives largely in isolation at higher altitudes. The original patchworks of mixed dominance may have been of some considerable importance in tempering the tendency towards podzolisation, birch and juniper being less active encouragers of mor than pine, and the greater extent of the forest cover must certainly have restricted the spread of Calluna, the abundance of which among the heaths of eastern Scot land may be very deleterious for any future expansion of pine. Distribution "
"w19","Zonation and succession Zonations between the two sub-communities of the Juniperus-0xalis woodland are most frequently a reflection of edaphic variation. Soil differences are involved, too, in transitions from the community to other vege tation types but, throughout, grazing, burning and timber removal have confused these patterns. Complex treatment histories also make it difficult to see how the community relates to other vegetation types in serai sequences and in natural altitudinal zonations of climax communities. Soil variations within stands of the Juniperus-0xalis woodland are generally related to differences in parent materials or the degree of flushing, with the Vaccinium-Deschampsia sub-community typically giving way to the Viola-Anemone sub-community wherever there is an increase in base-richness and fertility. Sometimes, as where there is an abrupt and marked shift in bedrock type, the edaphic and vegetational contrasts are sharp; often, especially where the community occurs over heterogenous superficials or experiences diffuse flushing, the change is a much more gradual one, manifest in ill-defined mosaics rather than clear zonations, a feature very well seen over the complex geology of the Morrone Birkwoods (Huntley & Birks 1979«, b). Often, now, the landscape context of stands of the Juniperus-Oxalis woodland is one dominated by various types of heath or grassland and, at lower altitudes, it is clear that the vegetation pattern is strongly related to biotic factors, partly deer-grazing but also various kinds of human interference. Nonetheless, zonations often preserve a measure of edaphic control. For example, transitions to Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath sometimes reflect an obvious move to drier and more strongly podzolised profiles, a switch which is sometimes related to the occurrence of highly siliceous parent materials or a complete waning of any impact of flushing with base rich waters (e.g. Huntley & Birks 1979«). In other cases, this type of soil and vegetation zonation is a reflection of slope and aspect: in the east-central Highlands, the Juniperus-0xalis woodland sometimes marks out damp hollows and north-facing slopes in tracts of heather moorland (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). In the opposite direction, on free-draining soils which are increasingly base-rich and calcareous, the community typically passes to some kind of calcicolous sward, often preferentially grazed by deer and stock because of its nutritious bite. On limestone or schist outcrops in the Dalradian and Moine rocks of eastern Scotland, such zonations https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.024 Published online by Cambridge University Press322 Woodlands and scrub usually involve the Festuca-Agr os tis-Thy mus grassland (e.g. Huntley & Birks 1979«); in Teesdale, with the switch from intruded Whin Sill dolerite to Carboniferous Limestone, the Sesleria-Galium grassland is represented (e.g. Pigott 1956tz, Graham 1971, Gilbert 1980). In situations such as these, the Juniperus-Oxalis woodland occupies the moister sites, where aspect or seepage prevent the development of excessively-draining soils. In other cases, as where heavy-textured superficials dominate among the parent materials, it may mark out better-drained areas, passing to various kinds of mires in hollows where there is ground-water gleying or a strong influence of soligenous waters. At Morrone, for example, a complex of flush communities occurs among the Juniperus-Oxalis woodlands with Pingui-culo-Caricetum mire figuring prominently in more baserich situations, the Scirpus-Erica wet heath in the more base-poor (Huntley & Birks 1979a). In the absence of enclosure experiments or any sus tained observations on the effects of burning within such sequences as these, it is difficult to know how far the limits of the Juniperus-Oxalis woodland are natural. However, waterlogging is strongly inimical to juniper, so the absence of the community from more hydromorphic soils probably represents a real edaphic boundary though, if there were no grazing, one might expect the Juniperus-Oxalis woodland to give way to mire scrub or forest in such situations, perhaps the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland in more base-rich places or the Salix-Carex woodland in the less. On drier soils, grazing and burning have almost certainly reduced the extent of the community, the former favouring an extension of grasslands, the latter, especially on more base-poor profiles, encouraging a spread of heaths, and especially the dominance of Calluna. In many sites, the composition of the Vaccinium-Deschampsia heath adjacent to the community is very similar (essentially it is often Juniperus-Oxalis woodland without the juniper) and the balance between ericoids and juniper in the invasion process after burning may be quite a fine one. Information on the precise effects of burning and herbivore predation is urgently needed for the sensitive conservation of this community. It would also enable us to see something of the serai processes in which juniper is involved and to assess the successional status of the community. To the north of its British range, juniper obviously colonises and maintains itself on a much broader spectrum of soil types than is the case in the southern lowlands and, in more natural circumstances, the community may develop along a number of serai pathways. Early invasion of very open habitats with fragmentary soils could be the normal mode of establishment for this light-demanding tree, in which case its colonisation of existing ungrazed herbaceous vegetation might depend on erosion on steeper slopes or clearance of the ground by spontaneous fires (e.g. Fitter & Jennings 1975, Miles & Kinnaird 1979). Over rocky ground and on ledges, juniper can also invade coincidentally with ferns, ericoids and tall herbs, occasionally finding a place in vegetation types like the Luzula-Vaccinium and Luzula-Geum communities (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Huntley & Birks 1979a). These ungrazed communities show a considerable floristic overlap with the Juniperus-Oxalis woodland, the former, characteristic of more base-poor rocks, resembling the Vaccinium-Deschampsia sub-community, the latter, typical of more base-rich situations, sharing many species with the Viola-Anemone sub-community. Where juniper is able to overtop the associates, it essentially converts the vegetation to the Juniperus-Oxalis woodland, though stands on ledges are very fragmentary. Subsequent developments probably depend on a number of factors. In theory, one would expect stands at lower altitudes to progress to forest dominated by pine and/or birch, with the Vaccinium-Deschampsia sub community on more acidic, impoverished soils moving to the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum or Pinus-Hylocomium woodlands, the Viola-Anemone sub-community on more base-rich and fertile soils to the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland or the Luzula sub-community of the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland. In some places, the different kinds of Juniperus-Oxalis woodland can be seen in gaps within these other woodland types, the field layers showing considerable continuity. In fact, re invasion of junipers and ericoid-dominated covers is very difficult for both pine and birch, because they are light-demanding, and with pine there is the additional problem of rather erratic fruiting and a less efficient wind-dispersal of seed than is the case with birch (Carlisle & Brown 1968, Carlisle 1977). Grazing can open up the ground but destroys seedlings; burning without grazing may be more effective but tends to allow Calluna to invade first; and widespread removal of timber, especially common and more critical with pine, has reduced the number of seed-parents. Just such a combination of factors seems to have converted the original patchwork of pine, birch and juniper forests in the east central Highlands to the pattern of woodland fragments among extensive tracts of heath and grassland that we see today (e.g. McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, O’Sullivan 1977). Widespread forest destruction has also left very few places where the Juniperus-Oxalis woodland can be seen as a convincing altitudinal replacement for sub-montane forest: the best site is probably Creag Fhiaclach where the community forms a scrubby fringe between the Pinus-Hylocomium woodland and montane heath (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). Elsewhere, though, the Juniperus-Oxalis woodland does persist as a fragmentary belt above a wide zone now largely converted to heath and grassland (Watt & Jones 1948, Poore & McVean 1957, McVean & Ratcliffe 1962). In such https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.024 Published online by Cambridge University PressW19 Juniperus communis ssp. communis-Oxalis acetosella woodland 323 situations as these, the community occupies an analogous position to the juniper scrub of the 'lower-alpine' zone in Scandinavia (Du Rietz & Du Rietz 1925, Nordhagen 1943). As there, though in much more fragmentary fashion, it shares this zone with scrub dominated by Arctic-Alpine willows like Salix lapponum, S. myrsinites and S. reticulata which replaces the Juniperus-0xalis woodland on wetter soils but has quite a strong floristic overlap with the Viola-Anemone sub-community. On the highly acidic rocks of the north-western parts of Scotland, this altitudinal zone is characterised by a scrubby heath in which J. communis ssp. nana plays a major role. Distribution "
"w2","Zonation and succession In the more extensive flood-plain mires of the Broadland river valleys, it is still possible to see complete and fairly straightforward zonations from open-water vegetation, through swamp and primary fen, to the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland, over fen peats which are increasingly free from inundation by the seasonally-fluctuating waters (e.g. Pallis 1911, Lambert & Jennings 1951, Wheeler 1980c, 1983). Where the base-status and calcareous nature of the peat are maintained, such sequences involve the Alnus-Filipendula sub-community which replaces, beyond the upper limit of the winter flood, the Peucedano-Phragmitetum, Local variations in the pattern of water fluctuation and uneven invasion of shrubs and trees frequently blur this boundary so that a hazy zone of scrubby vegetation lies between the fen and the woodland proper. There is variation, too, in the particular kind of Peucedano-Phragmitetum to be found in these zonations: along the Bure valley, for example, it is generally the Typical sub-community, dominated by Phragmites or less often and perhaps where conditions are more oligotrophic, Cladiunv, in the more eutrophic Yare fens, drier forms of the Gly ceria sub-community, usually dominated by Phragmites, are often involved. Outside Broadland, where flood-plain mires have been much fragmented and extensively drained, intact zonations of this kind are rare and such sequences as do survive generally have the less species-rich vegetation of the Phragmites-Eupatorium fen (most often its Phragmites or Cladium sub-communities) replacing the Peucedano-Phragmitetum. Less commonly, the Alnus-Filipendula sub-community may pass directly to the rather dry swamp vegetation of the Galium sub-community of the Phragmitetum. Transitions of this kind can be seen around some open waters in the Shropshire and Cheshire meres (Sinker 1962, Meres Report 1980) and in more base-rich valley mires, such as those in Breckland (e.g. Haslam 1965). Stratigraphical studies around the Norfolk Broads (Lambert & Jennings 1951, 1965, Jennings & Lambert 1951, Lambert 1951, Lambert et al. 1960, 1965) have shown that zonations of this kind can represent the progress of primary hydrarch successions in which the Alnus-Filipendula sub-community is the natural product of invasion of a variety of herbaceous fen types. This sub-community corresponds most closely with Lambert's 'fen carr' but it also includes some of what she would have called 'semi-swamp carr' and 'pseudoswamp carr’, woodlands which differ largely in their physiognomy and whose floristics can be comfortably subsumed within this single vegetation type. Although it has not been confirmed by stratigraphical analysis or long observation elsewhere, it seems likely that this line of development represents the major succession on our more base-rich topogenous mires, except where Carex paniculata figures prominently in the primary fens. Its rate of progress is difficult to assess but comparisons of maps led Lambert & Jennings (1951) to suggest that some of the swamp around the Norfolk Broads could have progressed to woodland over 150 years and Has lam (1965) adduced a similar process to have taken some 50 years in a Breckland valley fen. In many areas, including Broadland where exploitation of the fens was formerly very intensive, such primary succession was deflected by regular mowing for herbaceous crops and many of the present stands of the Alnus-Filipendula sub-community are found as the pro duct of secondary invasion among complex patchworks of vegetation types, variation among which is more https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.007 Published online by Cambridge University PressW2 Salix cinerea-Betula pubescens-Phragmites australis woodland 59 closely related to the previous mowing regime and the date of abandonment than to natural differences in the water-level. Often, such patterns have been further complicated by other activities. Where there has been peat-digging, for example, secondary fen and woodland on the drier baulks may be intermingled with primary herbaceous vegetation and woodland developing afresh in flooded workings (e.g. Lambert & Jennings 1951, Wheeler 1978). On more isolated mire fragments, where drainage and even cultivation have occurred over the peat surface, stands of the Alnus-Filipendula sub community can be found developing from fen remnants alongside suites of other rather different vegetation types on even drier and more disturbed ground or isolated within intensive agricultural landscapes. The Sphagnum sub-community is more local than the Alnus-Filipendula sub-community and its development has not been studied but it seems to be the product of a divergent succession from the kind described above. Quite small differences in the water regime, in surface pH and nutrient status may be responsible for determining which of the two sub-communities ultimately develops and such variation may be initiated early in the succession, even before the appearance of any woodland cover. Indeed, the Sphagnum sub-community is occasionally to be found in some basin and valley mires where the whole character of the habitat is shifted somewhat towards being less base-rich and calcareous. Usually, however, it is the occurrence of such conditions on a more local scale that seems to be the prelude to its appearance. In some cases, it seems possible that the remnants of a former, more extensive cover of acid peat may provide a congenial surface (Wheeler 1978). Ombrogenous peats are known or strongly presumed to have formed within some of the East Anglian floodplain mires in the past (Godwin & Clifford 1938, Poore 1956Z>, Walker 1970) and, though these have been largely stripped away, fragments may remain. Often, however, the typically small stands of the Sphagnum sub-community give every indication of representing new ombrogenous nuclei in which surface layers of more acid peat are accumulating afresh beneath a Sphagnum cover (Wheeler 1978, 1980c, 1983). Small domes of Sphagna can sometimes be found within herbaceous fens (e.g. Pallis 1911, Tansley 1939, Wheeler 1983) and these may form the basis of subsequent stands of the Sphagnum sub-community, being preferentially invaded from the start by Betula pubescens. Such a development seems to be particularly associated with floating mats of fen vegetation like those found in various parts of the Ant valley, most distinctively in shallow peat-cuttings as on the Catfield fens (Wheeler 1978). Here, rich Phragmi-tetum appears to progress to a striking kind of Peuce-dano-Phragmitetum dominated by Carex lasiocarpa. Within this, small islands of Sphagna form and these then act as centres for B. pubescens invasion (Giller 1982, Wheeler 1983). In these fens, and among other kinds developed on solid peat, certain kinds of mowing regime may help accentuate surface impoverishment and acidification so that, once treatment ceases, con ditions are inimical to the development of the Alnus-Filipendula sub-community. In other cases, it is possible that the Sphagnum sub community makes a late appearance in the succession, developing from the Alnus-Filipendula sub-community as conditions change. Such a process may be natural, as where the accumulation of litter raises the peat surface above the level of close influence by the ground water (e.g. Godwin & Turner 1933) or, as seems to have been the case at Wicken in recent years, it may be precipitated by the artificial prevention of flooding (Godwin et al. 1974). Only close monitoring of a variety of particular stretches of fen over long periods could provide some indication of the importance of these various possibilities. In neither of the two divergent lines of succession is it clear what the final vegetation types might be. It has been suggested on a number of occasions (e.g. Godwin & Turner 1933, Tansley 1939, Lambert 1951) that some kind of oakwood is the natural development from the Alnus-Filipendula sub-community. In some sites, transitions between these two woodland types can be found but extrapolating from such sequences to serai developments is dubious because the oak woodland frequently lies on the drier land surrounding the mire where the influence of'ts ground water had probably never been great. A more likely immediate successor to the Alnus-Filipendula sub-community is some kind of drier Alnus-Urtica woodland. The virtually complete eclipse of fen herbs in this latter community, the prominence of Urtica dioica and Rubi, the appearance of Sambucus nigra and the occurrence of a canopy in which Alnus generally predominates over Salix cinerea and Betula pubescens could be seen as natural developments over a peat surface which was being slowly converted to a humose mull with a high nutrient turnover. This kind of process seems to be in train, at least within the field layer, in Reserve A at Wicken (Godwin et al. 1974) and within the Askham woods (Fitter et al. 1980) and perhaps accounts for some of the later stages of the succession in the Breckland valley mires (Haslam 1965). The Sphagnum sub-community, on the other hand, seems more likely to progress to the Betula-Molinia woodland, in certain kinds of which Sphagna remain very prominent, along with an increased cover of Molinia caerulea, under an often moribund canopy of B. pubescens. Some of the islands of the Sphagnum sub community described from the Ant valley have a core of this kind of woodland in their drier centres (Wheeler 1978, 1980c) and such a development may also have occurred towards the back of Esthwaite North Fen in Cumbria (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wilson https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.007 Published online by Cambridge University Press60 Woodlands and scrub 1978). It is possible that such vegetation might eventually give way to ombrogenous mire with the disappearance of all tree cover, recapitulating the process that seems to have occurred in the past, even on those of our lowland mires which experience a drier climate (Pearsall 1918, Godwin & Turner 1933, Walker 1970, Wheeler 1978, 1983). The various vegetation patterns which result from the operation of these successions can be further complicated by the close proximity of the products of other serai developments within mires. In some cases, it is variation within the herbaceous vegetation that is being invaded that deflects the succession away from the formation of the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland. Where Carex paniculata is a prominent feature of swamp or primary fen, for example, the invasion of shrubs and trees is often early and results instead in the development of swampy Alnus-Carex woodland. Stands of this woodland can be found developing in both floodplain and valley mires, sometimes between the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland and open water, sometimes, marking the position of old channels and pools, behind it (e.g. Pallis 1911, Lambert & Jennings 1951). Usually, it is the Alnus-Filipendula sub-community that is found in this kind of zonation but, in the Ant valley, some of the larger stands of the Sphagnum sub-community have a core of Alnus-Carex woodland (Wheeler 1978). In other cases, variation in the pattern of sediment accumulation may lead to the development of other woodland types alongside the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland. Where there is deposition of alluvium, for example, more eutrophic fens and woody vegetation can occur among the sequences of communities on the peat. Such patterns are especially characteristic of some valley mires, where levees build up along the water's edge as suspended sediments are dropped in the flood. Then the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland behind gives way to a fringe of such herbaceous vegetation as the Phrag-mites-Urtica fen or the Phalaridetum progressing to wetter kinds of Alnus-Urtica woodland, dominated by Salix purpurea, S. triandra, S. viminalis or 5. fragilis. This kind of transition is a marked feature of the enriched zone alongside the Black Beck in Esthwaite North Fen (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wil son 1978). Finally, significant differences in the water regime and in the pH, calcium concentration and nutrient status may create conditions which locally prevent the development of tail-herb fen and subsequent Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland. This seems to happen along the margins of certain of the Broadland flood-plains, where the fens are isolated from the moving waters and in some places influenced by soligenous seepage, and also in some shallow, stagnant peat-cuttings (Wheeler 1978, 1980a, 1983). Here, stretches of the Salix-Betula-Phrag mites woodland give way to small-sedge mires. Similar habitat variation may also play some part in the com plex pattern of vegetation types seen in Esthwaite North Fen (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wilson 1978) where the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland lies behind a zone of the Potentillo-Caricetum fen which is developing into the Salix-Carex woodland. Interesting as these serai developments are, the for mation of the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland from a range of primary and secondary fens inevitably results in a loss of diversity among the vegetation. With the demise of mowing, extensive stretches of often speciesrich herbaceous vegetation, together with its particular associations of other biota, notably invertebrates (e.g. Ellis 1965), have been lost and the agricultural record, which the pattern of fen compartments, dikes and droves preserved, has been obscured. Only in a very few sites does mowing of fens continue (e.g. Godwin 1978) and attempts to preserve heterogeneity by woodland clearance are laborious and costly. However, where such clearance has been undertaken, at Woodwalton for example (Duffey 1971), the effects have been judged worthwhile. At this particular site, there has been the additional interest of the reappearance, after many years, of Viola persicifolia and the spread of Luzula pallescens in the open vegetation. Distribution "
"w20","Zonation and succession Most commonly, zonations from the Salix-Luzula scrub to other vegetation types are a reflection of variations in grazing pressure though, since these typically relate to differences in topography, edaphic factors sometimes play a part. Usually, the community occurs as small stands iso lated on rocky knolls and ledges within a montane landscape largely transformed by grazing to various kinds of close-cropped grassy or herb-dominated swards. In areas where calcareous rocks and soils are more common, as over the Dalradian schists and limestones of Breadalbane and in the Clova-Caenlochan district, the Salix-Luzula scrub overlaps altitudinally with more high-level stands of the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland and the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath. More flushed types of these two communities show strong floristic affinities with the Salix-Luzula scrub and have probably been derived from it by elimination of willows and tall herbs and a favouring of grasses and grazing-resistant dicotyledons. At higher altitudes, the community can also be found in association with the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene dwarf-herb community in which grazing-tolerant Arctic-Alpines are well represented and this kind of vegetation, too, may be a derivative of Salix-Luzula scrub, though it is characteristic of more exposed situations where solifluction and cryoturbation are important, so this transition may be partly an edaphic one. Floristically and environmentally, the Dryas-Silene community can be seen as intermediate between the Festuca-Alchemilla-Silene community and the Salix-Luzula scrub. Typically, it is much less heavily grazed than the former, though often in more unstable situations than the latter and it can occasionally have some of the larger Arctic-Alpine willows. Good transitions from the Dryas-Silene community to the Salix-Luzula scrub can be seen on Meall na Samhna, Carn Gorm and Beinn Dearg (Ratcliffe 1977), the willows increasing their cover in the latter vegetation and shading out many species of the former. Where calcareous rocks and soils form a much more local intrusion into landcapes dominated by acidic substrates, as among the Moinian and Lewisian rocks of the Cairngorms and the north-west Highlands, floristic transitions are usually much sharper: here ledges with the Salix-Luzula scrub may be surrounded by a small zone of more calcicolous grassland on flushed soils but often there is a fairly quick zonation to calcifuge grasslands and heaths on base-poor brown earths, gleys and peaty soils. In both these kinds of situations, the community typically occupies only some of the available ledges, others supporting very similar Luzula-Geum vegetation or, where flushing is with somewhat less base-rich waters, the Luzula-Vaccinium community. How far the willows could spread into these other vegetation types or into flushed, calcicolous swards, if grazing were to be reduced, is unknown. Reconstitution of the Salix-Luzula scrub would probably be very difficult, though enclosure of the surrounds of some more vigorous and https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.025 Published online by Cambridge University Press330 Woodlands and scrub mixed-sex willow populations would be an instructive exercise. On the Durness Limestone above Inchna-damph, Poore & McVean (1957) sampled a low-altitude scrub (210-274 m) where Salix myrsinites seemed to have re-invaded Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland and such expansion might be possible at higher levels. By and large, however, the Salix-Luzula scrub persists now as remnants isolated well above any other kind of woody vegetation. It seems reasonable to suppose, comparing the Scottish situation with Scandinavia, where similar vegetation is widespread, that the community was at one time much more common, replacing scrubby hazel-, rowan-and birch-dominated Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland at high altitudes on wet, calcareous soils. Nowhere, now, do such zonations persist intact. Distribution "
"w21","Zonation and succession Zonations between the Crataegus-Hedera scrub and other vegetation types are very varied but they usually represent stages in diverse successions between open ground or herbaceous vegetation on the one hand and woodland on the other, sometimes progressive, sometimes stabilised, sometimes moving in reverse and often represented by only part of the full sequence of communities. Surprisingly, in view of the very widespread occurrence of these successions, very few systematic studies of their operation have been undertaken. Potentially valuable early studies (e.g. Salisbury 191 Sb, Tansley 1922, Tansley & Adamson 1915, Brenchley & Adam 1915, Ross in Tansley 1939, Hope-Simpson 1940Z), 19416) were, for one reason or another, not followed through in detail and what other knowledge we have usually comes from comparison of different stands at different stages of development (e.g. Watt 1926, 1934a, Scurfield 1959, Merton 1970, Duffey et al. 1974) or more generalised observations (e.g. Thomas 1960, 1963). We are therefore much in need of long-term investigations of the progression of even the most ordinary processes here. Active and direct scrub colonisation of recently-or grossly-disturbed substrates is more common in artificial habitats like urban and industrial wasteland than in naturally unstable situations which are quite rare in the subdued landscape of lowland Britain. On neglected derelict land, the Crataegus-Hedera scrub is usually rep resented by the Hedera-Urtica sub-community springing up among mosaics of weed communities or weedy Arrhenatherion swards, together with Rubus-Holcus underscrub. Patterning is often rather chaotic and pro gression to woodland uncommon, partly because of the frequently recent and continuing disturbance and partly because, in more extensive sites, seed-parents of canopy trees can be quite rare. But Acer pseudoplatanus sometimes becomes very prominent and less isolated sites may have patchy stands of the Holcus lanatus sub community of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, dominated by sycamore with a littlè ash and Q. robur, which have perhaps developed from the scrub. Similar mixtures of weedy vegetation with scrub of the Hedera-Urtica sub-community can characterise abandoned ploughland on less base-rich brown earths. The frequency of this kind of site has varied according to the vagaries of the agricultural economy, fields sometimes falling into neglect when arable cultivation became unprofitable or in periods when incentives for ploughing pushed such cultivation on to marginal land that proved too intractable. Colonisation of such abanhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.026 Published online by Cambridge University Press342 Woodlands and scrub doned ground by woody species can follow diverse courses but with generally abundant supplies of seed in hedges and woodlands nearby, it is often more rapid and orthodox than on derelect land and some of the classic descriptions of the development of the Crataegus-Hedera scrub relate to such situations (Salisbury 19186 Brenchley & Adam 1915, Ross in Tansley 1939). As before, it seems likely that the Hedera-Urtica sub community develops into some kind of Quercus-P ter i-dium-Rubus woodland on more base-poor soils or, where Fagus figures prominently among the invading trees, into the Fagus-Rubus woodland (e.g. Watt 1924, 19346). On more base-rich but heavy soils, very common over the claylands of the Midlands and East Anglia, succession is more likely to lead to the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland with the Mercurialis sub community perhaps supervening between the Hedera-Urtica sub-community and richer forms of this forest; or the latter kind of Crataegus-Hedera scrub may develop directly to the Hedera sub-community of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland, as seems to have hap pened on Broadbalk Wilderness at Rothamsted (Brenchley & Adam 1915, Tansley 1939) and in the Hayley Triangle (Rackham 1975). Zonations involving the Hedera-Urtica and Mercurialis sub-communities are also common on less and more base-rich brown earths in lowland agricultural landscapes where scrub development has been precipitated by a decline in grazing by stock or wild herbivores, notably rabbits, or by neglect of mowing in field corners or more inaccessible parts of meadows. Usually, in such cases, weedy elements figure little among the associated herbaceous vegetation, grasslands being more prominent. Typically, on these often quite enriched soils, these are mesotrophic swards like the Lolio-Cynosuretum or the Centaureo-Cynosuretum or, more often in direct contact with the scrub, rank Arrhenatheretum or, on moister soils, the Deschampsia-Holcus grassland. Rubus-Holcus underscrub again frequently forms a fringe between the grassland and the scrub. On sea cliffs, where the Crataegus-Hedera scrub can develop in more sheltered situations, these grasslands are replaced by sequences of more maritime swards like the Festuca-Holcus or Festuca-Daucus grasslands or, where there is some grazing, the Festuca-Plantago grassland. In such situations, progressions to woodland are rare, but on neglected inland pastures and meadows the Crataegus-Hedera scrub seems to follow the same sequence as in successions on open ground, to Quercus-Pter idium-Rubus or Fagus-Rubus woodland on less base-rich soils or to Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland on the more base-rich but moist soils. On base-rich but more free-draining rendzinas, zonations typically involve the Brachypodium or Viburnum sub-communities and on freely-weathering limestone slopes free of heavy grazing, a situation seen especially well on Carboniferous Limestone exposures following myxomatosis, complete sequences from open fern-dominated vegetation, through tussocky Arrhenatherum to these kinds of Crataegus-Hedera scrub and woodland, can be found (e.g. Merton 1970). Usually, on Carboniferous Limestone, most of which lies beyond the natural limit of Fagus, different kinds of Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland represent the climax forest, with the Geranium sub-community predominating on steeper screes that have acquired a woodland cover fairly recently (Pigott 1960, 1969, Merton 1970). Longer-established Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland, among which open areas of Viburnum sub community scrub can be found on rocky knolls, is very locally of the Teucrium sub-community (Moss 1913, Pigott 1960, 1969, Shimwell 1968a, 6). On the gentler landscapes of the more southerly limestones like the Chalk and Oolite, zonations between the Brachypodium and Viburnum sub-communities and more open vegetation are often associated with artificially-disturbed sites like spoil heaps and quarry floors (e.g. Tansley 1922, Tansley & Adamson 1925, Hope-Simpson 1940a, 1941a) and rabbit warrens (Tansley 1939). In such places, these kinds of Crataegus-Hedera scrub can be found in mosaics with the calcicolous weedy vegetation of the Atropion alliance of the Epilo-bietea. On more impoverished and disturbed limestone soils, such as are exposed by ploughing and abandonment of very shallow rendzinas, the Viburnum sub community can be seen developing among open swards of the Festuca-Thymus-Hieracium grassland (Lloyd & Pigott 1967). Where scrub develops at a later stage in successions from open ground over limestones or invades long-established grasslands where grazing has been relaxed, the Brachypodium and Viburnum sub-communities are typically found in mosaics with closed Mesobromion swards. What these are depends partly on the regional and local climate, partly on the soil conditions and partly on the grazing regime before scrub invasion. By and large, the distribution of these two kinds of Crataegus-Hedera scrub coincides with the range of the major lowland plagioclimax calcicolous grassland, the Fes tuca-Avenula sward, and different types of this community usually constitute the starting point for successions; towards the north-west, there is a small overlap with Sesleria albicans swards, the Sesleria-Scabiosa and Ses-leria-Galium grasslands; along the oceanic seaboard of the west and south, the Festuca-Carlina grassland can show sporadic progression to scrub, though the edaphic and climatic conditions characteristic of this sward are usually too extreme to support any growth of woody species. Most of the trees and shrubs of the Brachypodium and https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.026 Published online by Cambridge University PressW21 Crataegus monogyna-Hedera helix scrub 343 Viburnum sub-communities can invade (or, if sup pressed saplings are already present, get away in) these grasslands once grazing is relaxed but, quite often, a coincidental spread of ranker grasses means that scrub development is occurring among mosaics of these swards and grasslands dominated by Bromus erectus and/or Brachypodium pinnatum (especially to the south) or B. sylvaticum or, on somewhat deeper soils, Festuca rubra, Avenula pubescens or Arrhenatherum elatius. And, among these latter communities, the advance of scrub may be accompanied by a fringe of Rubus-Holcus underscrub, a feature well seen in Tansley's (1922) account of invasion at Downley Bottom on the South Downs. After the demise of rabbits with myxomatosis in the mid-1950s, mixtures of all these vegetation types have become extremely common, particularly on the southern Chalklands (e.g. Thomas 1960, 1963, Wells 1969, Ratcliffe 1977). Although advanced scrub development in this kind of landscape usually results in a great floristic impoverishment, more open mosaics of short swards, rank grasslands and scrub on limestones represent one of the richest complexes of vegetation types that are found in lowland Britain, with a structural variety that can be of importance to the diversity of invertebrate and bird populations (e.g. Duffey et al. 1974, Smith 1980, Fuller 1982). Post-myxomatosis successions are too young for any extensive progression to mature forest yet to have occurred but, over much of the southern Chalk, the Fagus-Mercurialis woodland is probably the natural climax community on moderately free-draining rendzinas, with the Taxus woodland replacing it locally on slopes with a warmer topoclimate (Watt 1926, 1934a). Beyond the natural limit of beech, such successions probably terminate in the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland with Fraxinus and Acer pseudoplatanus very well represented in younger, secondary canopies. In all these different kinds of succession, scrub advance can be halted by a re-imposition of grazing or mowing which typically results in sharp boundaries between the grassland and scrub quite unlike the gra dual and uneven transitions of active colonisation. Such abrupt zonations are the norm on hedgebanks where linear stands of Crataegus-Hedera scrub, often of planted origin though sometimes the remnants of woodlands adjacent to the path or road, are fronted by mesotrophic or calcicolous grasslands artificially maintained, usually by mowing, with perhaps a very con densed zone of Rubus-Holcus underscrub between. All the sub-communities can be found in such zonations, the particular arrangement of the scrub, underscrub and grassland components varying according to the verge and hedgebank structure, something which often shows marked regional differences along older routes. Similar condensed transitions can be seen where the Crataegus-Hedera scrub occurs as a marginal fringe to mature woodland. Very heavy grazing or cutting or burning of scrub followed by grazing and mowing can reverse successions to the Crataegus-Hedera scrub though it is probably very difficult to restore the richer, more long-established swards from which the serai progressions often start, especially where scrub invasion is well advanced and destruction of the trees and shrubs involves great disturbance. Then, the scrub is likely to be replaced by weedy vegetation or rank Arrhenatherion grasslands. Gradual scrub destruction by long-continued grazing is probably more successful in restoring richer herbaceous communities and some stands of the community may represent an intermediate stage on a retrogressive sere from woodland back to grassland, initiated and maintained by grazing (Moss 1913). Distribution "
"w22","Zonation and succession The Prunus-Rubus scrub is typically found in zonations and mosaics with grasslands, underscrubs and woodlands, sometimes representing active successions on wasteland, in neglected farmland or in coppice plots and clearings, in other cases in more stabilised sequences in exposed situations or along wood margins and rides, by hedges and in field corners. Most often, the associated grasslands are ranker, mesotrophic swards, among which various kinds of Arrhenatheretum figure prominently or, on somewhat moister soils, the Holco-Juncetum or Holcus-Deschampsia grassland. The former are very common where the Prunus-Rubus scrub is colonising drier pasture or where it constitutes the core of hedges, where the Hedera-Silene sub-community is typical; the latter occur with the community in ill-drained pastures or where scrub is spreading into rides and clearings within woodlands on heavy and especially trampled soils and here the Viola-Veronica sub-community is more frequent. Less commonly, the Prunus-Rubus scrub occurs among somewhat more calcifugous grasslands and heaths, as where the community is invading neglected commons. Frequently, the transition from the scrub to the grassland is marked by an untidy fringe of the Rubus-Holcus or Pteridium-Rubus underscrubs. The kinds of woodland most frequently associated with the Prunus-Rubus scrub are the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland on more base-poor soils and the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis on heavier, more base-rich soils and the community grades floristically to these forest types through their Hedera sub-communities. More locally, towards the south, the Prunus-Rubus scrub can be found with the Fagus-Rubus woodland and, around flushes, it can pass to the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland. Although successions have not been followed, it seems likely that the community can develop into any of these woodland types where saplings of the canopy trees are able to invade and overtop the Prunus'. although forming a dense canopy, Prunus is readily shaded out once trees have begun to emerge. The most usual climax woodlands would seem to be the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus and Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodlands and stands of the Prunus-Rubus scrub can quickly spring up in stretches of these communities where rides are neglected or areas cleared and left. However, although complete zonations from grasslands, through underscrub and the Prunus-Rubus scrub to woodland can be seen, the community often occurs in broken or abbreviated zonations where succession has been halted for one reason or another. It is common, for example, as a narrow static fringe along woodland rides and around wood margins. Many hedgerow stands have a similar appearance, with a linear stand of the scrub and a much-compressed zone of underscrub and grassland maintained by mowing or grazing. On sea-cliffs with more mesotrophic soils, the Prunus-Rubus scrub often terminates the sequence of vegetation types on the unenclosed cliff top, the Hedera-Silene sub community occurring in more sheltered situations, the Dactylis sub-community in more exposed places, and giving way below to maritime grassland, usually some type of Festuca-Holcus grassland. Sometimes there is an intervening zone of the Pteridium-Rubus underscrub and, on moister soils, the Festuca-Hyacinthoides grassland beyond this, Prunus and then Rubus and Pteridium petering out as one moves seawards. In other places, these communities can be replaced by the Arrhenatheretum in this transitional zone. Distribution "
"w23","Zonation and succession Most commonly, the Ulex-Rubus scrub occurs as small stands in mosaics with grasslands, heaths, underscrubs and other kinds of scrub on marginal agricultural land. It is also widespread as a fringe to certain kinds of woodland and can occur in hedgerow sequences. The former kinds of pattern are very diverse and often related to complex histories of land use but the range of communities involved is fairly small and distinctive. The grasslands most frequently encountered with the Ulex-Rubus scrub, and forming the ground where the community occurs in pasture, are the more mesotrophic forms of the Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grassland and the more calcifugous types of improved swards in the Lolio-Cynosuretum and Centaureo-Cynosuretum. In all these communities, the characteristic herbs of the Ulex-Rubus scrub figure prominently and, in zonations, there is often a strong floristic continuity between the open grassland and the vegetation beneath and among the gorse. In sea cliff sequences, these communities are replaced by their maritime equivalents in the Festuca-Holcus and Festuca-Plantago grasslands. Where grazing is less intense, transitions from scrub to grassland may be marked by a zone with bracken, either the Pteridium-Galium community or the Pteridium-Rubus underscrub, invariably of the Teucrium sub-community on these soils. Where there is some diversity in the soils, the Ulex-Rubus scrub can be found colonising alongside other kinds of scrub or with heath. On less base-poor soils, which are sometimes moister than the profiles characteristic here, the community may give way to the Crataegus-Hedera scrub or, commonly on exposed sea-cliffs, to the Prunus-Rubus scrub, where mixtures of U. europaeus and Prunus spinosa can sometimes be found over a rather similar field layer to that typical of this community. Where there is a switch to more acidic and impoverished profiles, the Ulex-Rubus scrub can be found among heaths: on commons, the community often forms a zone around enclosures and settlements and linear strips running along tracks through the heath. The particular heath communities involved vary according to the geographic region: to the south of England, the Calluna-Ulex minor, Ulex minor-Agrostis curtisii or Ulex gallii-Agrostis curtisii heaths usually provide the context, to the west the Calluna-Ulex gallii or Calluna-Erica cinerea heaths, and on the more maritime parts of sea cliffs, the Calluna-Scilla verna heath. U. europaeus continues to be a local dominant in some of these communities and there is often a considerable overlap in the associated herbaceous floras of both the heath and the scrub. Both U. europaeus and Cytisus are naturally rather short-lived species (individuals lasting ten years or so) and imposition of grazing or periodic burning may prevent any successional developments beyond the establishment of Ulex-Rubus scrub so that, in many cases, there may be a cyclical alternation of the community with grassland or heath, perhaps with a phase of dominance by eutrophic tall herbs where burning and disturbance expose rich soils. In exposed places, too, as on sea cliffs, the Ulex-Rubus scrub may represent an end point in the development of woody vegetation. But where there is shelter from winds and some freedom from grazing and burning, trees can invade more open stands of the community: like juniper, gorse itself may provide some measure of protection from herbivores, saplings growing up inside more leggy bushes or within enclosed enclaves of herbaceous vegetation. The commonest invaders are birch and oak, Betula pendula and Quercus robur predominating but B. pubescens and Q. petraea becoming more frequent to the north and west and Q. petraea locally frequent even in the south-east. Pinus sylvestris is also a prominent coloniser where it is able to seed in from nearby plantations and there can be some Sorbus aucuparia and Ilex aquifolium. Scattered saplings of all these species and locally dense stands of young birch among patches of the Ulex-Rubus scrub with heaths, open grassland areas and tracts of bracken have become a characteristic feature of many lowland commons with the decline in their traditional uses as a source of grazing and mown crops. Successions in such situations as these have never been followed in detail but it seems likely that the usual replacements for the Ulex-Rubus scrub in uninterrupted seres are the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland on more fertile brown earths (perhaps the Holcus sub community with its grassy field layer lacking slow-spreading herbs like Hyacinthoides non-scripta), itself perhaps succeeded within the natural British range of beech by the Fagus-Rubus woodland, and the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland on somewhat more acidic and oligotrophic soils. Where this kind of scrub extends into the upland fringes, the oak-birch climax forests may be represented by the north-western Quercus-Betula-Oxalis and Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodlands. The Ulex-Rubus scrub is also found in close spatial association with woodlands, generally the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, where underwood or canopy has been cut and, in the absence of cleaning or careful attention to planted saplings, it may herald a run-down of the woodland. The community also occurs widely as a more or less permanent fringe to this kind of woodland, kept in check by intensive use of the neighbouring land. Distribution "
"w24","Zonation and succession The Rubus-Holcus underscrub is found in mosaics and zonations with a wide variety of herbaceous communities but a relatively small number of scrubs and woodland types. Often, these patterns are a clear expression of serai sequences in various stages of active development but many are incomplete or, very commonly, stabilised, either by their coming to a natural halt or by being subject to some form of treatment along their margins. In areas of more open ground, the community, usually represented by the Cirsium sub-community, typically occurs with weedy vegetation in which Chenopodium spp., Artemisia vulgaris, Rumices, Epilobium angustifolium, Urtica dioica or, along pathways, trampling-resistant plants like Plantago major and Poa annua, occur: mosaics of communities dominated by such species, with patchy Rubus-Holcus underscrub among them, are very characteristic of derelict land. Continuing disturbance (often including burning) and the shortage of seed-parents often limits colonisation by shrubs and trees but zonations sometimes continue to Crataegus-Hedera scrub and even to woodland, usually some form of Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland. Less frequently, the Cirsium sub-community can be found among various kinds of heath on disturbed commons, though here it usually marks out small enclaves of more enriched soils among stretches of Ulex-Rubus scrub. The usual context for the Arrhenatherum-Heracleum Crataegus-Hedera scrub Rubus-Holcus underscrub Arrhenatherum grassland Lolium-Cynosurus grassland Figure 25. Patterns of grassland, underscrub and scrub in neglected pasture and on managed verge. W21 W24 MG1 MG6 sub-community is an agricultural landscape where this type of Rubus-Holcus underscrub generally forms a part of patterns involving pastures like the Lolio-Cynosure-tum, grazed and mown grasslands like the Centaureo-Cynosuretum or periodically-cut swards like the Arrhe-natheretum. Transitions through to scrub and woodland are more common here where neglect has been of long standing, and usually involve the Crataegus-Hedera or Prunus-Rubus scrubs and the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland or its beech analogue, the Fagus-Rubus woodland. On somewhat more base-rich brown earths, the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland may figure. The Arrhenatherum-Heracleum sub-community is also very widespread in zonations around wood margins and along hedgebanks, where sequences of these grassland, In such situations and in more extensive stands where dense growth of the brambles may hinder invasion by shrubs or trees, the Rubus-Holcus underscrub can attain some degree of stability. Often, however, taller woody species invade with the Rubus and overtake it in a progression to scrub and woodland. In most cases, the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland appears to be the natural climax on the kinds of soils typical of the Rubus-Holcus underscrub or, more locally, the Fagus-Rubus woodland. In both of these communities, brambles play an important role in the field layer and, in younger stands of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, Holcus lanatus and various of the other mesophytic or weedy species important here, continue to be well represented. It is in this kind of woodland, too, that the Rubus-Holcus underscrub shows its most prominent resurgence after coppicing or clear-felling and dense stands of the community may hinder regrowth of stools or establishment of any new planted saplings. Distribution "
"w25","Zonation and succession The Pteridium-Rubus underscrub is commonly found in close association with woodlands or other replacements for them within predominantly agricultural or heath landscapes. Sometimes, the derivation from woodland is clear, as where the community occupies rides and clearings, extensive glades in wood-pasture, old coppice compartments or clear-felled sites; in other cases, the historical connection with long-lost woodland is more tenuous. In general, though, this is a vegetation type of regressive seres and the overwhelming dominance of bracken itself, together with the effects of grazing and burning, may prevent re-establishment of woodland. The community shows a close floristic relationship to the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, the main Car pinion forest of base-poor brown earths in the British lowlands, and, where it occurs within or adjacent to woodland, it is almost always of this type, the underscrub running from glades and rides under the tree and shrub canopy with very little change apart from some attenuation of the bracken and bramble cover. The Hyacinthoides sub-community is very similar to the field layer of the Typical sub-community of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, the Teucrium sub community to the Holcus lanatus sub-community of the woodland, a common forest type of plantations; and, in the woodland context, the particular kinds of vegetation involved may be largely a reflection of treatment. Where the woodland has totally disappeared, stands of the community can remain isolated, marking out the original site and sharply delimited from the surrounding landscape of improved agricultural grasslands or arable. In less intensive landscapes, the Pteridium-Rubus underscrub can persist as a field-border community and then it may form part of a fairly ordered sequence from grasslands through to remnants of woodland or scrub. Par ticularly striking zonations of this kind can be seen on the sea-cliffs of western Britain where the Pteridium-Rubus underscrub occurs interposed between maritime grasslands and scrub (Malloch 1970, 1971). In these situations, the different edaphic preferences of the two sub-communities are well seen, the Hyacinthoides type being found between Festuca-Hyacinthoides grassland and the Prunus-Rubus scrub on moister, mesotrophic soils, the Teucrium type occurring with the Festuca-Holcus grassland and the Ulex-Rubus scrub on more acidic profiles. In more degraded heath landscapes, the Pteridium-Rubus underscrub is represented by the Teucrium sub community which usually accounts for but a small proportion of the bracken-dominated vegetation, most of it clearly belonging to the more calcifugous Pteri-dium-Galium community. Vegetation patterns in such situations are usually complex mosaics but small stands of the Ulex-Rubus scrub can often be found with the Teucrium sub-community forming a patchwork over the less-impoverished soils. Although natural senescence of bracken may permit re-invasion of woody species, healthy Pteridium-Rubus underscrub is probably very resistant to progression back to climax forest. Birch or, on moister and more fertile soils, ash and sycamore are possible invaders here but none is well equipped to grow on thick bracken litter or in denser shade. Quercus robur can fare better, though it too may suffer under thicker bracken covers (Jones 1959). The proportion of surviving bramble in the underscrub may be important here, since it casts lighter shade and helps maintain the mull humus regime on which most of the eventual forest dominants can thrive, hindering the run-down to more impoverished conditions. Although less widespread than the Pteridium-Galium community, the persistence of the Pteridium-Rubus underscrub bears similar testi mony to the long history of woodland clearance, grazing and improvement in the southern lowlands of Britain. Distribution "
"w3","Zonation and succession At some sites, the Salix-Carex woodland occupies a clear position in open-water transitions running from the woodland on the driest peats through fen and swamp to aquatic vegetation. At Crag Lough, for example, the community has a fringing front of very wet Potentillo-Caricetum fen which gives way, in turn, to the Caricetum rostratae, the Equisetetum fluviatile or related societies of Potentilla palustris and Menyanthes trifoliata (Lock & Rodwell 1981). A similar pattern is found in Esthwaite North Fen, though here, the Phragmitetum and Scirpe-tum lacustris also play a part in the swamp sequence (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wilson 1978). In more fully terrestrialised basin mires, the community characteristically occurs in complex patchworks of vegetation that involve a variety of rich and poor fens related to local variations in seepage and through-put of waters of different pH and calcium content. Again, the Potentillo-Caricetum can play a part in such mosaics but, more often, it is some kind of Carex rostrata-Calliergon mire that provides the bulk of the herbaceous vegetation around the Salix-Carex woodland with a more local development of poor fens like the Carex rostrata-Sphagnum squarrosum community. If there is some deposition of alluvium alongside inflow streams, Filipendulion communities may complicate the pattern. This kind of mosaic is seen very clearly at Malham Tarn (Proctor 1974, Adam et al. 1975; Figure 17). At this site and in some other basin mires, the Salix-Carex woodland can also be found forming a marginal belt around areas of Sp/ztzgwww-dominated mires with patchy Betula-Molinia woodland. Such situations ap proach those found in raised mires where, likewise, the community can occur in the lagg giving way sharply towards the mire centre to acidophilous bog and woodland (e.g. Rankin 1911/)). The small amount of stratigraphical data available from mires such as these (Lock & Rodwell 1981, Webb & Moore 1982) suggests that the Salix-Carex woodland has developed from fens such as the Potentillo-Caricetum and the Carex-Calliergon mire though the exact relationship of such successions to natural changes in the habitat has not been monitored. Nor do we know how rapidly such developments proceed under normal circumstances, though photographic evidence from https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.008 Published online by Cambridge University Press68 Woodlands and scrub Figure 17.

At Esthwaite, too, colonisation has been quite rapid since the early surveys (Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wilson 1978). But both these sites have moderately eutrophic waters and, in more impoverished basins, change may be much slower. The eventual fate of such successions is unknown but it seems unlikely that the Salix-Carex woodland progresses to, say, Alnus-Urtica woodland except where stands are drained and dis turbed. It is possible, too, that sinking of the fen mat under the weight of the developing canopy sets back further succession in some cases. One other possibility is that the community is a prelude to the development of more ombrotrophic vegetation as terrestrialisation isolates the mire surface from the ground-water. In this respect, the occasional occurrence of patches of Sphagna within the field layer of the Salix-Carex woodland is of interest. Further sampling may permit the characterisation of a distinct sub-community of this woodland in which Sphagna are more prominent, with a decreased representation of some of the dicotyledons and certain Carices, as in the southern Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland. The pro gression of such vegetation to herbaceous bog (perhaps with an intervening stage with the Betula-Molinia woodland) would then leave the Salix-Carex woodland per sisting only on the marginal fen peat (Walker 1970, Proctor 1974, Wheeler 1983). As on southern flood plain mires, the conditions for such a development might well be initiated within the herbaceous fen before any shrub invasion had taken place. Distribution "
"w4","Zonation and succession Very often, the Betula-Molinia woodland occurs in zonations and mosaics with other vegetation types which reflect the progress of birch invasion on mire surfaces. On ombrogenous and topogenous mires, it is typically found in association with Erico-Sphagnion and Ericion tetralicis bogs and wet heaths and fragments of such vegetation types persisting within the field layer of the Sphagnum sub-community can give some clue as to its origin. On raised mires and in basin mires where the waters are not base-rich and calcareous, this kind of Betula-Molinia woodland may represent a fairly natural first development in the progression to woodland with increased elevation of the peats above the ground water level and, in some places, crudely concentric zonations can be seen which approximate to the classic hydroserai pattern as in some Shropshire meres (Sinker 1962) and at Malham Tarn (e.g. Proctor 1974). At certain sites, as at Malham again, the zonation continues to the drier Dry opter is-Rubus sub-community which may represent the continuation of a succession towards acid oak-birch woodlands. Very often, however, patterns are not so clear as this and fragments of these two sub-communities frequently occur intermixed with variously modified remnants of mire vegetation on peat surfaces that have been subject to complex histories of draining, burning and cutting (as at Woodwalton: Poore 19566). Similar treatments may also have encouraged the development of the Betula-Molinia woodland where it occurs on the margins of run-down blanket mires. Other kinds of complexities arise where there has been woodland development over mire surfaces with varying https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressW4 Betula pubescens-Molinia caerulea woodland 75 water and nutrient regimes. In flood-plain mires, for example, the Betula-Molinia woodland can mark out ombrogenous nuclei which have formed within tail-herb or Carex-dominated fens. In the Ant valley, the Sphagnum sub-community forms a core to some of the striking islands of Betula-Salix-Phragmites woodland that have grown up among the Peucedano-Phragmitetum fen (Wheeler 1978, 1980c) and, at Esthwaite, it has developed behind a front of Potentillo-Caricetum fen which is progressing to the Salix-Carex woodland (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wilson 1978). Similar, though more complex, patterns occur around peat islands in the Malham fens (Proctor 1974, Adam et al. 1975). The Juncus sub-community can also be found in association with mire communities. In the rands of basin mires, for example, it often occurs amongst rush-or sedge-dominated vegetation of the Caricion curto-nigrae or Junco-Molinion and these would seem to be the normal serai precursors to this kind of woodland in such situations. In valley mires, and in soligenous soakways on some ombrogenous mires, it can be found in mosaics with Ericion tetralicis vegetation and may develop from this by birch invasion. Where this kind of Betula-Molinia woodland marks out slope flushes with peaty mineral soils, rather different patterns are encountered. Usually here, the Juncus sub-community occurs as small stands within more extensive tracts of drier woodland, very often at junctions between acid oak birch woodlands on permeable sandstones above the flush line, and less acidophilous Carpinion woodland on the shales or drift below.Distribution "
"w5","Zonation and succession Around standing and slow-moving open waters, the Lysimachia and Phragmites sub-communities are often found in zonations running from woodland, through swamp, to aquatic vegetation, as around some of the Norfolk Broads (e.g. Pallis 1911, Lambert & Jennings 1951, Lambert 1951) and at Sweat Mere (Clapham in Tansley 1939, Sinker 1962). Most frequently, it is Carex paniculata swamp that forms an immediate front to the Alnus-Carex woodland but sometimes invasion of the developing sedge tussocks is so rapid that there is no distinct sedge swamp but simply a belt of helophyte swamp dominated by Phragmites australis or Typha angustifolia between the young woodland fringe and the open water. Where invasion has been substantially delayed, a belt of sedge-dominated fen (the Peucedano-Phragmitetum or Phragmites-Eupatorium fen) may supervene between the woodland and the swamp. On drier ground, the Lysimachia and Phragmites sub-communities can pass to drier carr of the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland, still over peat, or directly to some kind of mixed deciduous woodland, usually in these southern lowlands, the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland. However, in the latter case, quite gradual transitions in both woody species and field layer may, in fact, mask discontinuities in substrate and soils, as where mire deposits give way to solid valley sides around. On more extensive flood-plain mires with a long history of exploitation, various kinds of human disturbance can complicate this basic pattern. Peat-digging, for example, can create new hollows which, when abandoned and flooded and colonised with swamp and swamp-woodland, produce local reversals in the general trend (well seen in some of the profiles of Lambert & Jennings 1951). Then, mowing for fen-crops can create extensive stretches of secondary herbaceous vegetation behind the Alnus-Carex woodland, though in most places such mowing-marshes have been abandoned now and colonised by the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland or, where there has been much disturbance and enrichment of the dry peat surface, the Alnus-Urtica woodland. Along the water's edge, too, zonations have been modified, as where boat-traffic and the depredations of coypu have fretted away the fringe of swamp and left rather moribund stands of Alnus-Carex woodhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.010 Published online by Cambridge University PressW5 Alnus glutinosa-Carex paniculata woodland 85 land abutting directly on to open water. Eutrophication of open waters has also encouraged the development of Phragmites-Urtica fen along the front of some tracts. There is a continuous series of zonations between the more extensive sequences of vegetation types described above and the much narrower belts of communities found on the peaty terraces of small slow-moving rivers. Here, the Alnus-Carex woodland (usually, in these sites, the Phragmites sub-community) can be found occupying the flat and winter-flooded ground of the terrace with fragmentary swamp along the water's edge and a very sharp transition at the valley side to mixed deciduous woodland. Quite commonly, the swamp-woodland is separated from the moving river waters by a narrow belt of the Alnus-Urtica woodland on levees of rich alluvium, behind which conditions may be virtually stagnant. These kinds of patterns now often survive isolated in intensive agricultural or afforested landscapes where the valley sides have been cleared for pasture or a tree crop. In valley mires where there is some persisting influence of more base-rich and eutrophic waters along the central axis, the Lysimachia or Phragmites sub communities can occur as a central strip of woodland sandwiched between parallel belts of very wet poor-fen with Sphagna (especially S. recurvum) and dominants such as Carex rostrata, Equisetum fluviatile and Juncus acutiflorus or Junco-Molinion vegetation, which in turn passes to Sphagnum pools and then to wet and dry heath. This is the classic kind of zonation described from some valley mires in the New Forest (Rankin 191 lô, Rose 1950, McVean 1956Ô, Wheeler 1983). Similar, though often compressed and fragmented, patterns can be seen around the margins of some basin mires where there is a local influence of more base-rich soligenous waters in the lagg (as at Rhos-goch Common: Bartley 1960). The characteristic association of the Chrysosplenium sub-community with seepage zones means that it is often found as small stands isolated within stretches of drier, usually mixed deciduous woodland. In such situations, it can be seen as the less base-rich analogue of the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland: like that vegetation it usually interrupts stretches of bluebell or mercury woodland or straddles transitions between the two over junctions of less and more base-rich soils. Where see page is sufficient to create the semblance of a small valley mire, it may form more extensive sinuous stands following the line of water movement. Stratigraphical studies in Broadland (Jennings & Lambert 1951, Lambert & Jennings 1951, Lambert 1951, 1965) have shown that the more intact zonations from open water to Alnus-Carex woodland represent a primary hydrosere in which aquatic vegetation, then Typha, Phragmites and Carex swamps are naturally succeeded by invasion of woody species. More fragmen tary studies at Sweat Mere in Shropshire (e.g. Sinker 1962) suggest that a similar process has occurred there. Although both sedge-swamp and swamp-carr were poorly represented in the numerous profiles examined in Walker's (1970) survey, it seems likely that this succession is the normal one around more base-rich and eutrophic open waters in the British lowlands (Wheeler 1978, 1980c, 1983). Despite the primeval appearance of many stands of this woodland, it is clear that it can develop from open water within little more than a century (Lambert 1951, 1965, Sinker 1962). Some stands, though, may be considerably older because this appears to be a fairly stable kind of vegetation and there is no firm evidence that it habitually progresses to drier carr, say of the Salix-Betula-Phragmites type. This may happen in some more isolated parts of flood-plain mires or in those valley mires where there is substantial deposition of alluvium but often the woodland becomes moribund before the general peat surface has become markedly dry, trees collapsing and sedge tussocks decaying to initiate the cycle of development over again (e.g. McVean 1956&). In some situations, marked enrichment of the waters and substrates (say, through sewage or fertiliser contamination or massive deposition of mineral material), may precipitate a succession to wetter kinds of the Alnus-Urtica woodland. Although some drier stands of the community may have been cleared in the past for the extension of mowing-marshes (e.g. Lambert 1965), the frequently intractable topography of the Alnus-Carex woodland has given it some protection against conversion to secondary fen. However, where clearance has occurred, the community is not able to re-develop on the abandonment of mowing unless there is substantial inundation by base-rich and moderately eutrophic waters, in marked contrast to the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland which is very often found as a secondary woodland over old mowing-marsh. Where cattle have access to drier stands, they can graze down the tall herbs and physically damage the sedge tussocks which can lead to a gradual run-down of this woodland type. Light burning of stands among heathland in the New Forest does not totally destroy Alnus which can produce abundant basal sprouts (McVean 19566). Where the local influence of base-rich waters is ulti mately insufficient to offset the development of more acid peat, as in some valley mires and basin mires, the Alnus-Carex woodland may give way eventually to Sp/zagHww-dominated mire. Such a development was suggested by Rose (1950) for some New Forest valley mires and it may be happening, too, around the ombrogenous nuclei found in some Broadland fens (as in the Ant valley: Wheeler 1978, 1983).

Distribution "
"w6","Zonation and succession The Alnus-Urtica woodland is now rarely found as part of extensive zonations on alluvial soils because so many flood-plains have been extensively reclaimed for agriculture. Most often, the Salix fragilis and Typical sub https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.011 Published online by Cambridge University Press96 Woodlands and scrub communities survive as small, isolated stands within active loops of slack lowland rivers or around abandoned but still wet pools. They sometimes pass directly to open water or are fringed by a belt of eutrophic herbaceous vegetation, such as the Phragmites-Urtica fen, or Phalaris fen over silt, or by a zone of inundation vegetation over less stable alluvium or river shingle. Landward boundaries are often abrupt, with a sharp transition to improved pasture or arable but more neglected fringes may have a belt of Urtica or Epilobium hirsutum or rank Arrhenatheretunr, in other cases, a boundary ditch occurs with swamp vegetation. In nar rower valleys, where small alluvial terraces abut directly on to surrounding slopes, stands of the Salix fragilis or Typical sub-communities can pass sharply to some kind of mixed deciduous woodland. Where slope-flushes run down on to the flats, the Alnus-Fraxinus-Ly simachia woodland may form a transitional zone between. On older drier terraces in this kind of situation, the Sambucus or Betula sub-communities occur on the stabilised alluvium, and there seems little doubt that these kinds of Alnus-Urtica woodland are a natural serai development from the wetter sub-communities on gradually accumulating mineral material. The succession might be expected to progress to Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland with the gradual invasion of Quercus spp., Pteridium aquilinum and herbs like Anemone nemorosa and Ranunculus ficaria. In valley mires and flood-plain mires, the wetter kinds of Alnus-Urtica woodland are sometimes found in zonations close to open water with stands of Salix-Betula-Phragmites or Alnus-Carex woodlands or the Salix-Carex woodland, but typically they mark areas of alluvial deposition behind which peat is accumulating, rather than forming an integral part of a single hydrarch succession. This is well seen alongside the Black Beck in Esthwaite North Fen (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wilson 1978). More usually on extensive peats, the Alnus-Urtica woodland occurs more deeply within the fen system forming complexes with other woodlands and herbaceous communities and here it seems to represent a secondary development attendant upon late eutrophication of the habitat. This may happen naturally where deep fen peats dry out superficially and become oxidised with a release of nutrients, but in many cases it has probably been assisted by draining, the surface disturbance of peat-digging and inwash of fertiliser run-off: complex histories of this kind seem to lie behind the development of the community in sites like Woodwalton (Poore 1956&), Reserve A at Wicken (Godwin et al. 1974) and Askham Bog (Fitter et al. 1980). In such situations, the usual precursor of the Alnus-Urtica woodland seems to be the Salix-Betula-Phragmites woodland which may progress fairly rapidly to the Typical or Sambucus sub-communities and then perhaps the Betula sub-community. In less base-rich situations, as in some basin mires, the Betula sub community may develop more directly from the Betula-Molinia woodland on grossly-disturbed acid peats. Distribution "
"w7","Zonation and succession Typically, this community occurs as fairly small stands within more extensive stretches of other kinds of woodland, marking out sites where a strong influence of ground water interrupts vegetation patterns determined in large measure by variations in the base-richness of the soils. The most frequent context for the Carex-Cirsium sub community is some kind of less calcifugous oak-birch woodland clothing the surrounding slopes of arenaceous or argillaceous bedrocks or fairly light-textured drift with more freely draining brown earths. Where the interruption of drainage of the ground water is very slight or localised, as where thin shaley partings occur within sandstone sequences or where superficials become more clayey, the flush woodland may form no more than a small (though often repeated) variation in a more or less uniform woodland cover. In other cases, the patterning is more pronounced, as where there are more vigorous flushes or where very young river valleys have cut through shales, where the concave slope above the outer swing of every meander can have an undercut, slumping flush occupied by the Carex-Cirsium sub community, alternating with drier oak-birch woodland on the intervening bluffs. Some very good examples of this last kind of pattern can be seen in the Carboniferous sediments of the Pennines and in Northumberland. The particular kind of oak-birch woodland involved in such zonations depends on the regional locality of the flush. Over much of the range of the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland, it is the north-western Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland, as in the Lake District, the northern Pennines and Scotland. Further south, it is the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, often in the southern Pennines and Wales the Acer-Oxalis sub-community, in the occasional Wealden localities the Anemone or Typical sub-communities (Figure 18). A quite frequent complication of this general pattern is produced where the impervious substrate giving rise to the flushing is more calcareous than the pervious deposit above. Then, the Carex-Cirsium sub-community can straddle the junction between two kinds of woodland, the flush biting back into the more calcifugous vegetation above and spilling down on to the more calcicolous cover below. This is very well seen in those Wealden woods where flushing occurs at the junction of the Hythe Beds above, carrying Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland and the Atherfield Clay and Weald Clay below, with Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland. A similar zonation occurs further north where more calcareous shales interrupt sequences of less calcareous grits, though where there is flushing with markedly base rich waters in the north-west, the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland is generally replaced by wetter kinds of Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland. In all these situations, the Deschampsia sub-community can be found in association with the Carex-Cirsium sub-community as a transition to the woodland on drier soils around. However, it frequently occurs without the Carex-Cirsium sub-community, marking out strongly-gleyed patches with the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus and Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodlands on less well drained gentle slopes and plateaus or where there is a switch to more heavy-textured drift. It can also spread along rides and paths within these woodlands where trampling consolidates heavy-textured soils. To the north-west, transitions between the Deschampsia sub-community and the surrounding woodland, which are already often very gentle, can be further blurred by grazing throughout. The Urtica sub-community is often found in the same kinds of woodlands as the two other sub-communities and, where flush waters drain down through colluvium and on to stream-side flats, it can occur in close association within them, all three forming a complex suite. In other cases, it occurs alone on alluvium, passing more sharply to the woodland on the drier valley sides. Where there is some variation in canopy cover, a frequent natural feature in less stable stands of the Carex-Cirsium sub-community, but also found where timber has been cleared, the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland can form mosaics with Filipendulion tail herb vegetation. Where the Urtica sub-community is opened up with some disturbance, patches of nitrophilous tail-herb vegetation are often found and clearance of the Deschampsia sub-community can result in a spread of Rubus-Holcus underscrub and the Deschampsia-Holcus grassland. Where clearance has been more extensive, the site of the woodland may be marked only by a small patch of flushed herbaceous vegetation in a stretch of improved grassland. In general terms, it is probably some kind of Filipendulion vegetation which forms the natural precursor to the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland, though succession has never been followed in detail. With continued flushing and gleying, the community can probably persist as a more or less permanent feature but, with increased drying of the soil, as, for example, on up building alluvium beneath the Urtica sub-community, progression to the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus or Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland might be expected, with a decline in nitrophilous herbs and Alnus, a spread of Rubus and an invasion of oak, Hyacinthoides and Pteridium. Distribution "
"w8","Zonation and succession Most commonly, zonations between different kinds of Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland and from this community to other woodland types are under the primary influence of soil variation. Treatment differences can accentuate or confuse such patterns and also produce direct effects of their own. Agricultural improvement has often truncated zonations and created a wide variety of artificially sharp transitions to herbaceous vegetation. Over wooded tracts of suitably base-rich soils, the most widespread zonations between different sub-communities here are related to variations in soil moisture. On the heavy, impermeable clays which form the typical substrate for the community in much of the south and east, such variations are often directly dependent on the extent of surface-water gleying, itself a function of slope. Slope differences are often very slight over the clay superficial characteristic of many stands of Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland in East Anglia and the east Midlands, but quite sufficient to induce a shift from the Primula-Glechoma sub-community to the Anemone sub community wherever there are flatter plateaus on which water becomes perched or shallow hollows into which it runs. As in the patterns described above from Hayley Wood, there is often a superimposed zonation of dominance within these sub-communities, as the major spe cies succumb in turn to the increased waterlogging (Abeywickrama 1949, Martin 1968, Martin & Pigott 1975, Rackham 1975). Quite frequently, too, the zonation continues to the Deschampsia sub-community on even more waterlogged soils. This kind of woodland can be found in wet hollows within stands of the Anemone sub-community but it also often forms a transition around flushes and springs to some type of alder woodland. Flushes in this kind of situation often carry the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland but, where there is pronounced ground-water gleying and some accumulation of fen peat below spring-heads, the Alnus-Carex woodland can terminate the sequence. Repeated pat terns of this kind are very characteristic of the more calcareous strata of the Wealden and Atherfield Clays in Surrey and Kent, where series of springs emerge at the base of the overlying Lower Greensand. Where streams with some alluvial deposition flow through Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodlands, the Deschampsia sub community can give way to the more eutrophic Alnus-Urtica woodland on the flats. Flush-surround and stream-side zonations of this type are also quite frequent to the north and west, where Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodlands can sometimes be found on more calcareous shales of the Carboniferous and Oolite sequences or over superficials. Typically, though, the substrates of the community in this region are more free-draining limestones and the Primula-Glechoma sub-community is absent. More usually, here, there is a rather sharp transition from any stands of the Anemone or Deschampsia sub-communities to the Geranium sub-community on rendzina soils over steeply-sloping surrounding ground. On this more rugged topography of the north and west, however, aspect can confuse this basic pattern because, on cooler and wetter north-facing slopes, the Anemone and Deschampsia sub communities can sometimes extend on to quite steep ground, forming patches within tracts of the Geranium sub-community (or the rarer Teucrium sub-community) over pockets of moister soil. Such patterns are well seen in some of the Derbyshire Dales and in the Mendips, where opposite faces of the valleys and gorges can present a sharp contrast in the extent of the different sub-communities. Finally, on the steeper slopes in this region, downwash is often important and a very typical pattern here is for the Geranium sub-community to give way to the Allium sub-community wherever there is an accumulation of deep, moist and free-draining colluvium. Although all kinds of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland are characteristic of more base-rich soils, individual woodland sites in which the community is represented often span geological transitions to less calcareous rocks or superficials. Then, zonations to less calcicolous woodland can be found, usually to the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, which is the counterpart of this community throughout its range on brown earth soils of moderate to low base-status. Where there are sharp bedrock differences, as where limestones or calcareous shales or clays are interbedded with arenaceous deposits, a common feature of the Carboniferous, Jurassic and Cretaceous sequences, the corresponding vegetational boundaries can be quite clear. However, it is important to remember that some of the leading species in the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland continue to be prominent in the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland and can therefore run across such junctions with no change in their abundance. Among the woody species, for example, Quercus robur, Carpinus betulus, Tilia cordata, Corylus and Crataegus monogyna https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.013 Published online by Cambridge University PressW8 Fraxinus excelsior-Acer campestre-Mercurialis perennis woodland 143 and, in the north-west, Acer pseudoplatanus, can all occur commonly in both communities; and, among the field-layer plants, Hyacinthoides, Rubus fruticosus agg. and, on moister soils, Anemone and Ranunculus ficaria can likewise be found in both. Usually, however, these transitions from one community to the other are marked by an obvious fading in the prominence of Fraxinus, Acer campestre (and, in the north-west, Ulmus glabra), Mercurialis, Geum urbanum, Circaea lutetiana, Arum maculatum and Viola reichenbachiana and by an increase, at least where the soils are not waterlogged, in Pteridium. In the south-east, the transitions commonly involve a switch from the Primula-Glechoma, Anemone or Hedera sub-communities of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland to the Typical, Anemone or Hedera sub-communities of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland respectively, depending on such factors as the amount of soil moisture and light. To the north-west, analogous transitions are usually from the Geranium sub-community of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland to the Holcus mollis sub-community of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland. Over superficial deposits where there can be very diffuse or disorderly variations in calcium carbonate content and base-status, transitions may be much harder to discern or understand. Sometimes, sandier patches are marked by obvious islands of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland within tracts of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland, as at Gamlingay in Cambridgeshire (Adamson 1912) and many other East Anglian woods (Rackham 1980). In other cases, there may be no more than the haziest impression that one kind of woodland is trying to 'break through' the other with scattered Mercurialis and Pteridium intermixed over soils of intermediate quality. There are situations, too, where variations in the base status of the soils within woodlands are related, not to geological differences, but to flushing with calcium-rich waters. Where streams flow through stands of the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland, for example, the better drained of the alluvial flats often carry fragments of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland, sometimes little more than small patches of Mercurialis inside every loop of the stream with an occasional scattered Fraxinus. These were a marked feature of the Carpinus-dorninated woodlands described from Hertfordshire by Salisbury (1916, 1918«) but the phenomenon is very widespread. Very commonly, and especially in the south-east, these kinds of soil-related zonations within stands of the community and to other types of woodland are overlain by treatment-derived patterns of variation. Sometimes, treatments have reinforced elements of natural zonations by selecting for trees or shrubs favouring particular soil conditions and accentuating their association with a certain field layer (as with Carpinus in the Anemone sub-community). Usually, however, treatments have been applied with no reference to the disposition of soils of different moisture content or base status, so that coppice compartments or patterns der ived from timber extraction or replanting are superimposed independently over the natural transitions. This means that woods often show fairly clear soil-related variations within the field layer and equally clear but artificial and quite differently-disposed differences in the cover of underwood and timber. As described above, different styles of treatment can affect the field-layer composition and physiognomy in the various sub-communities in different ways, but much of this variation can be seen as temporary (often cyclical) disruptions which do not, in the long term, modify the soil-related patterns. By and large, then, zonations persist while treatment-derived mosaics come and go within their components and across their boundaries. But there are some exceptions to this general rule. First, where trampling and increased light are combined, as they are when tracts are coppiced or clear-felled and allowed to regenerate (or planted with the usual hardwoods of the community), the parcel or compartment is often clearly marked out by a stretch of the Deschampsia sub-community which interrupts the natural zonation. Where short-cycle rotations are maintained on soils approaching the wet state of those normally occupied by this vegetation, the stand may persist. And, where trampling and high light levels are maintained permanently along paths and rides, there can be similar sudden switches to the Deschampsia sub-community, winding in narrow strips through the wood or marking out regular compartments in a grid. Second, there can be abrupt transitions to the rather species-poor and gloomy vegetation of the Hedera sub community at the boundaries of tracts where regrowth has been left unhindered for more than 20-50 years or so as in long-neglected coppice parcels or in planted com partments at the pole stage. Often, too, newer additions to older woods, originating from planting or by spontaneous invasion, show a sharp switch to the Hedera sub community at the original boundary, or a little way beyond it if there has been time for invasion of the more slow-spreading herbs (as in the Hayley Triangle: Rackham 1975). Third, at those few localities to the north and west where the Teucrium sub-community survives, the boundaries between it and the more widespread Geranium sub-community seem to mark a treatment-related dis tinction between older woodland that has escaped gross interference and younger woodland derived by a mix ture of planting and natural regeneration on open ground over the past few centuries (Pigott 1960, 1969, Merton 1970). As noted earlier, such boundaries are often compounded with a topographic and edaphic https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.013 Published online by Cambridge University Press144 Woodlands and scrub transition to less intractable ground where treatment has been easier to execute and colonisation speedier. Finally, here, topographic alterations to the woodland environment associated with sylvicultural treatments have sometimes modified soil conditions themselves and produced artificial edaphic zonations. Woodbanks, for example, are often better-drained than their surrounds and can provide, in the south-east, a belt of the Primula-Glechoma sub-community terminating (at the wood boundary) or interrupting (within woods) a stretch of the Anemone or Deschampsia sub-community. Where older stands of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland have been cleared and replanted, ancient banks can provide narrow strips of richer field-layer vegetation with Mercurialis, Hyacinthoides and Primula vulgaris, often with interesting relic boundary specimens of Tilia cordata or Carpinus, surviving within tracts of the Hedera sub-community and providing nuclei from which the herbs can subsequently spread. Wood-banks are often too substantial to have been totally destroyed when compartments have been turned over to agricultural use in the past, but ploughing has often evened out natural surface undulations, so any new woodland developing on such sites shows much less variation in the ground topography and soil water content. Quite fre quently, though, ploughing has created patterns of its own, notably ridge-and-furrow and, where woodland has been long established over abandoned farmland, the field-layer herbs can sort themselves over the drier ridges and wetter furrows such that stripes of the Primula-Glechoma and Anemone sub-communities alternate one with the other. Almost always now, stands of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland in the south-east, whether they comprise whole woods or the marginal parts of more varied sites, have artificially sharp boundaries. Where older woodlands survive intact, the boundaries may be very old, but, even in such cases, stands are invariably very closely hemmed in by intensive agricultural land. Many stands, of course, have been reduced in extent: here the boundaries are younger but generally equally abrupt. The usual picture now is of isolated fragments, often fringed by a narrow band of the shrubs and climbers of the community or by a belt of stabilised Crataegus-Hedera scrub with Rubus-Holcus underscrub below and a basal zone of the Arrhenatheretum, then a sharp transition to an arable crop (the usual pattern over much of East Anglia) or intensive pasture (as in wetter areas like parts of the Midlands). Where zonations are very tight, elements of all these vegetation types may be compressed into a confused mixture that can defy classification. To the north and west, the pattern is a little different. The losses here have also been extensive though, in many places, they have been to commercial forestry, not to agriculture. But, where stands do persist or have developed more recently within stretches of agricultural land, their boundaries are frequently not so sharply defined from the surrounding vegetation. Very often this is pasture of a less improved kind and under less intensive management than in the south-east. Where grazing (it is usually by sheep or mixtures of sheep and cattle) is lighter or more sporadic, stands can develop quite an extensive fringe of Crataegus-Hedera scrub or mixtures of young Fraxinus, Betula spp., Acer pseudoplatanus and Ulmus glabra. A typical picture in many parts of the Yorkshire and Derbyshire Dales is for patchworks of stands of the Geranium sub-community of different ages to be disposed over Carboniferous Limestone scree slopes with intervening stretches of open calcicolous grassland, either the more northerly types of the Festuca-Avenula grassland or Sesleria-dominated swards (e.g. Merton 1970). Where complex surface topography hinders grazing, rather specialised mosaics with herbaceous vegetation can be found. Over Carboniferous Limestone pavements, for example, fragmentary miniaturised stands of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland are frequently found in the deeper, shaded grikes, the canopies of the trees and shrubs browsed and wind-pruned at the level of the pavement surface and the herbs of the community disposed over grike-bottom soil and on small ledges and in crevices. Fern-dominated vegetation often occurs intermixed with the woodland and, where the clefts give way to shallower solution hollows in the more accessible and exposed clint surfaces, the mosaics include developing stands of Sesleria-Galium grassland. The quite common existence of younger stands of the community to the north-west has meant that it has been possible there to monitor its serai development or make deductions about succession from spatial patterns (e.g. Scurfield 1959, Okali 1966, Merton 1970). In the southeast, evidence is more fragmentary: opportunities provided by some early studies, mostly on abandoned farmland, (e.g. Adamson 1912, 1921, Brenchley & Adam 1915, Salisbury 191 Sb, Tansley & Adamson 1925) have largely been lost and neglected open ground is now very rare. The most that can be done here is to collate existing results (e.g. Tansley 1939), add such continuing observations on these sites as there have been (Pigott 1977), set these in the context of the ecology of the mature stands of the community (e.g. Rackham 1980, Peterken 1981) and make some educated guesses. And, also, consider the conclusions in the light of more detailed work on successional development of related communities like the Fagus-Mercurialis and Taxus woodlands (e.g. Watt 1923, 1925, 1926, 1934a, b). This latter is of some considerable importance because it seems clear that, within the natural British range of Fagus, the starting point for the development of https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.013 Published online by Cambridge University PressW8 Fraxinus excelsior-Acer campestre-Mercurialisperennis woodland 145 climax Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland is not usually bare limestone or shallow rendzina soils with calcicolous grasslands. Quercus robur is, in any case, at some disadvantage against Fraxinus in the more excessi vely draining of these situations but, more importantly, neither of these trees can ultimately compete with Fagus, especially in areas like the Chilterns where the climate is drier. Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland certainly can develop over deeper rendzinas carrying swards like those of the Festuca-Avenula grassland (or its less hea vily grazed derivatives dominated by Bromus erectus or Brachypodium pinnatum) and perhaps even from more fragmentary soils over Chalk spoil in quarries and pits (e.g. Tansley 1922, Tansley & Adamson 1925, Hope-Simpson 19406, 19416, Wells 1969, 1973). But, even where rainfall is higher, as in the North and South Downs, it appears to be often a serai stage in the eventual development of beech forest (Watt 1925, 1934a, b). Much more locally, Taxus can overtake young FraxzHws-dominated stands of the community and come to dominate in yew forest (Watt 1926). Much more likely precursors of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland in the south-east are the more calcicolous forms of mesotrophic grasslands developed over deeper, moister base-rich soils derived from argillaceous bedrocks, like calcareous clays and shales, and calcareous superficials. Here, Quercus robur is very much at home and can maintain its important role amongst the mixtures of more calcicolous trees and shrubs that eventually come to dominate. However, because the vast majority of these soils have been under cultivation (or existing woodland) for very long periods of time, we do not know what the natural course of succession might be. Where the community has arisen secondarily on abandoned farmland, quite diverse lines of development have been seen to converge into young stands of the community. On old arable land with loamy brown earths, early mixtures of weeds have been seen to progress to some kind of Arrhenatheretum, then scrub, then woodland (as on Broadbalk Wilderness: Brenchley & Adam 1915, Tansley 1939); on heavier clay soils (as in Geescroft Wilderness: Brenchley & Adam 1915, Tansley 1939, Pigott 1977), Holcus-Deschampsia grassland has gained a dominant hold and a slower invasion of shrubs and trees has been observed; within abandoned pasture, the more vigorous of the existing grasses have grown rank as woody species have colonised to form 'tumbledown' scrub and then woodland (e.g. Adamson 1912). From what we know of the ecology of existing stands of these precursors and of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland itself, the limits defining the possible development of the community are almost certainly edaphic and, though they are quite wide, these seem to be fairly well defined. On better-drained soils, basestatus is likely to be the controlling factor, so the most obvious precursors will be the Centaurea and Pastinaca sub-communities of the Arrhenatheretum, the Avenula pubescens grassland or, where old pasture runs down, the more calcicolous forms of the Centaureo-Cynosure-tum and the Lolio-Cynosuretum. Less base-rich soils with other sub-communities of these mesotrophic grasslands are likely to develop eventually into the Quercus-Pteridium-Rubus woodland. With increasing soil moisture, the Holcus-Deschampsia grassland, and perhaps also certain kinds of Holco-Juncetum, mark the probable limits of invasion: where waterlogging becomes more extreme, Salix cinerea and Alnus begin to assume importance as invaders and succession moves to wetter kinds of woodland. The major trees of the south-eastern types of Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland can invade these com munities directly, provided there is no undue restriction on colonisation in general by the growth of very rank grasses (like Deschampsia)'. even Quercus robur which now regenerates badly within existing stands of woodland has no difficulty in appearing within old pasture. However, very frequently, there is a preliminary stage of scrub development before the woodland proper, especially where existing grassland is being colonised. In this scrub, Crataegus monogyna is almost invariably a major component and early stages in succession usually converge into the Crataegus-Hedera scrub, through which the trees of the community eventually emerge. The appearance of a stand of the south-eastern kind of Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland with all its diag nostic woody species {Fraxinus, Q. robur, Acer cam pestre, Corylus and Crataegus) does not necessarily take very long: the early studies were dealing with tracts which had already attained this degree of maturity after only 50 years or so. However, it probably takes very much longer for the other woody associates to appear in the kinds of mixtures that are widespread in the southeast with Tilia cordata, Carpinus, Sorbus torminalis and Crataegus laevigata. And, some of the most characteristic herbs of the community are very slow to colonise: young stands are often clearly of the Hedera or, over moister soils, the Deschampsia sub-community. Even after 90 years, the Geescroft woodland had acquired little more than a marginal fringe of Mercurialis (Pigott 1977) and Rackham (1975) estimated that it would take at least another 150 years for the Hayley Triangle (already 50 years old) to acquire something like the herbaceous flora of the older parts of the wood. To the north-west, the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland can also probably develop from mesotrophic swards over more heavy-textured calcareous soils, though, with the higher rainfall here, there is an increased tendency for succession in moister situations to move towards its upland counterpart, the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland (as in higher-altitude dale https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.013 Published online by Cambridge University Press146 Woodlands and scrub heads) or the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland (where there is pronounced local flushing). More fre quently in this region, which is largely outside the natural range of Fagus, the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland is the culmination of the invasion of bare limestones and shallow, free-draining rendzinas. Its usual precursors are therefore calcicolous grasslands, either the Dicranum sub-community of the Festuca-Avenula grassland (in the Mendips, Derbyshire and Durham), the Sesleria-Scabiosa grassland (in Durham) or the Sesleria-Galium grassland (in the Yorkshire Dales and around Morecambe Bay). Usually, it is grazing which mediates the succession on more accessible slopes here. These often have a somewhat more intact and deeper soil cover, derived by long weathering or from colluvium, glacial drift or loess and, in such situations, Crataegus is again an important early invader, sometimes thickening up to form dense Crataegus-Heder a scrub before being overtaken by colonising trees (Scurfield 1959, Pigott 1969, Merton 1970). Over more broken slopes with scattered outcrops and fine talus intermixed with downwash, Corylus can colonise quickly and, on warmer slopes, it is often accompanied by Cornus sanguinea, Rhamnus, Euonymus and Rosa spp. (in the so-called 'retrogressive scrub' of Moss 1913: see Merton 1970). It is this kind of scrub which seems to persist as the understorey in the more open stands of the Teucrium sub-community (Pigott 1969). Very often, however, and especially on coarser, and even mobile, talus, Fraxinus invades very open herbaceous vegetation in the early stages and, with little or no grazing, it can quickly overtake Crataegus or Corylus and establish the basis of a canopy of Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland. Very commonly, too, it is accompanied or sometimes largely replaced by Acerpseudoplatanus'. although this tree is often found associated with disturbed sites (like mine spoil or failed plantations: Merton 1970), its prominence in successions in the region is closely related to the wetness of climate and soil. How well it competes with Fraxinus is unclear: Okali (1966) suggested that it was less tolerant than Fraxinus of sub-optimal conditions, though availability of seed-parents may have been an important factor in the development of the local variation in the relative abundance of these trees that can be seen now (Merton 1970). Clearly, though, both species and, more locally, birch (usually Betula pendula on the drier soils), have behaved almost like woody weeds in the speedy and diverse successions that have given rise to many stands of the Geranium sub-community. Although Merton (1970) reported the presence in scrub of certain herbaceous species usually associated with older stands of north-western Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodlands (Convallaria majalis for example), there is again little doubt that it takes some time for developing stands to acquire the full range of canopy and field-layer species. Ulmus glabra is usually slower to colonise than Fraxinus and Acer pseudoplatanus and, towards the north-west, A. campestre is approaching the limit of its range. Quercus, too, has been notably unsuccessful in gaining a place in younger stands. The herbaceous component in the early stages also often has a strong representation of the grassland or open scree species with Arrhenatherum elatius, Brachypodium syl vaticum and Geranium robertianum prominent. The complexity found in the Teucrium sub-community may take many generations to develop and some of its typical species (like Tilia cordata) now regenerate very infrequently. Distribution "
"w9","Zonation and succession Transitions between the two sub-communities of the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland are primarily related to grazing pressure. The Crépis sub-community tends to replace the Typical sub-community in areas inaccessible to large herbivores, like ledges and steeper ravine slopes or pavements with numerous deep grikes (e.g. McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Birks 1973, Ratcliffe 1977) and, because of the topographic irregularity of many sites, such zonations are usually complex mosaics with small fragments of the former scattered through the latter. However, there is no doubt that the Crépis sub community attains its most luxuriant development where lack of grazing is combined with abundant soil moisture, so stands also often pick out dripping rock faces or flushed areas. Zonations to other kinds of woodland are usually related more directly and exclusively to changes in parent materials and soil conditions. Where the soils are derived entirely from native bedrocks, a common pat tern is for the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland to give way to the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland as calcareous rocks with more base-rich mull brown earths pass to more acid deposits with leached brown earths with moder or mor humus. Betula pubeseens, Sorbus aucuparia and Corylus may run through both communities, together with Hyacinthoides, Oxalis, Viola riviniana and many of the grasses, but Fraxinus (and Ulmus glabra if it is present) fade, and herbs such as Mercurialis, Geum urbanum and Circaea lutetiana are replaced by Potentilla erecta, Galium saxatile and Pteridium. In regular sequences of limestones or calcareous shales and arenaceous strata, a frequent feature of Carboniferous deposits, this kind of zonation can be well ordered and obvious: in parts of the Yorkshire Dales, for example, where deep valleys have been cut through more or less level-bedded rocks, a typical pattern is for the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland to occupy the valley-side slopes over the Great Scar limestone with the Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland on the brow tops, over Yoredale deposits (Figure 20). Where sequences are less ordered, deposits thinner or https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.014 Published online by Cambridge University PressW9 Fraxinus excelsior-Sorbus aucuparia-Mercurialis perennis woodland 165 Figure 20. Mixed deciduous and oak-birch woodlands at Kisdon Force, North Yorkshire. Topography (a) with (b) the disposition of W9 Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis and W11 Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodlands and (c-e) sections through and across the hollow and spur. steeply inclined and incised by actively-eroding streams into younger irregular ravines, the vegetation patterns can be more complex with small fragments of both kinds of woodland succeeding one another up and across the valley sides. This is a feature of sites on Ordovician and Silurian deposits in Wales and south-east Scotland (Ratcliffe 1977, Ferreira 1978). On many igneous and f \c d (e) W9Wil https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521235587.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press166 Woodlands and scrub metamorphic rocks, more calcareous stretches are exceptional and here very small stands of the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland can be found embedded within extensive tracts of Quercus-Betula-Oxalis woodland or, where there is a more marked shift in rock and soil acidity, the Quercus-Betula-Dicranum woodland, as in north Wales, the Lake district and north-west Scot land (Ratcliffe 1977). The presence of superficial deposits frequently con fuses such zonations. Over more calcareous till or head, the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland can still be extensive but more arenaceous drift may restrict its occurrence over suitable bedrocks and tends to shift the whole sequence of woodlands towards the more calcifu-gous extreme. Very heavy rainfall may have the same effect so that, in the far north-west of Scotland, the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland occupies only the most lithomorphic soils and, even then, can have fragments of much more calcifugous herbaceous vegetation within it on nidus-capped boulders (e.g. McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Birks 1973). Zonations to woodland on strongly-flushed soils are also quite common and they almost always involve the Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodland, the typical alderwood of more base-rich stagnogleys. Species such as Filipendula ulmaria, Deschampsia cespitosa, Athyrium filix-femina and Lysimachia nemorum remain prominent in this community and Viola riviniana, Oxalis acetosella and Dryopteris dilatata can run some way into the surrounds but increasing Alnus dominance and the appearance of plants like Chrysosplenium oppositifolium, Carex remota, C. pendula and Juncus effusus usually serve as a good distinction. Where flushing is regular, as along an impervious parting, the pattern of repeated slumped triangles of this woodland within stretches of Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland can be very striking. Elsewhere the emergence of ground water is much more disordered and the mosaics consequently more complex. However, the frequent association of the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis, Quercus-Betula-Oxalis and Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodlands on sequences of base-rich, base-poor and gleyed brown earths in the north-west is exactly analogous to zonations of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis, Quercus-P ter idium-Rubus and Alnus-Fraxinus-Lysimachia woodlands on comparable soils in the south-east, as for example in the Weald. The landscape context of the Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland is usually that of pastoral agriculture along the upland fringes, where stands of the community represent some of the last vestiges of a woodland cover now confined to the more intractable slopes, crags and pavements. Grazing by stock as well as by deer is frequent in the Typical sub-community and this vege tation sometimes gives way, with varying degrees of sharpness, to semi-natural calcicolous pasture. Usually, this is Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland or, in the Pennines, the more surface-leached kinds of Sesleria-Galium grassland or, in northern Scotland, the Dryas-Carex heath (e.g. Birks 1973). Where limestone crops out as pavement, as on the Yorkshire Dales Carboniferous or the Skye Durness Limestone, fragmentary stands of the community can be virtually confined to drift-filled grikes, forming complex mosaics with the grasslands on the clint surfaces (e.g. Birks 1973). Where grazed stretches are flushed, base-rich small-sedge mires, like the Carex-Pinguicula flush, may occur in close juxtaposition with Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland. Although successions to this community have never been studied, such grasslands as those mentioned above would probably revert back to Fraxinus-Sorbus-Mercurialis woodland if neglected: this kind of woodland probably represents the climax vegetation over more calcareous soils in sub-montane and cool oceanic regions. However, on a very local scale, one other kind of agricultural treatment has been important in deflecting progressions to the community. Where tree and shrub cover thins out very substantially in the less-grazed Crépis sub-community, the field layer becomes very similar to the Anthoxanthum-Geranium grassland. This is the vegetation of the unimproved hay-meadows of sub-montane parts of the Pennines and it seems highly likely that such swards have been derived from this woodland by repeatedly setting back invasion of woody plants by an annual mowing for hay (Pigott 1956a, Bradshaw 1962). Zonations between the two communities are rare, but sometimes contiguous stands occur on identical soils, separated only by a wall. Open woodlands very similar to the Crépis sub-community have traditionally been mown in other parts of northern Europe (e.g. Nordhagen 1928, 1943, Sjörs 1954, Böcher 1954). Distribution "
