"s3","Zonation and succession The Caricetum paniculatae may abut directly on to open water or give way to the Phragmitetum australis or the Typhetum angustifoliae. Although many stands are small and zonations fragmentary, the community is sometimes part of an intact sequence of vegetation from such deeper water swamps to carr (Clapham in Tansley 1939, Lambert 1951, Sinker 1962). In such cases, the Caricetum paniculatae may represent the most species poor swamp phase of C. paniculata dominance and give way to woodland through types of richer fen in which the sedge is still very prominent but where there is a more advanced colonisation of older tussock tops by Salix cinerea or S. atrocinerea and Alnus glutinosa, as in the https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.033 Published online by Cambridge University PressS3 Caricetum paniculatae sedge-swamp 137 communities of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum and the Phragmites-Eupatorium and Phragmites-Ur tic a fens. There is strong circumstantial, or sometimes firm stratigraphical, evidence for regarding such zonations as representing a serai development from open water to woodland in which the Caricetum paniculatae plays a major part (Clapham in Tansley 1939, Lambert 1951, Lambert & Jennings 1951, Sinker 1962, Wheeler 1983). Around pools in pasture, such sequences as those described may terminate above in an abrupt transition from the Caricetum paniculatae to some kind of grazed Calthion grassland within which tree colonisation is repeatedly set back. Where the community occurs more patchily in res ponse to local infiltration of calcareous, base-rich waters into basin mires, it may be surrounded by a variety of poor fens or base-poor mire communities (e.g. Poore & Walker 1959).
