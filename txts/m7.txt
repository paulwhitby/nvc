"m7","Zonation and succession The community is typically found as small stands, most commonly in association with high-altitude Calluna- Eriophorum blanket mire, usually of the Vaccinium- Hylocomium sub-community (the Empetreto-Eriophore- tum of McVean & Ratcliffe 1962), within which it can occupy hollows or drainage channels or form part of recolonising vegetation over eroded areas (McVean & Ratcliffe 1962, Eddy et al. 1969). Transitional zones around such stands of the Carex-Sphagnum russowii mire are often marked by an increase in Eriophorum vaginatum and a shift towards dominance of S. papillosum in the moss carpet. In other situations, the community can mark out spring or seepage lines within tracts of montane moss-heaths like the Carex bigelowii-Polytri- chum alpinum or Racomitrium-Carex bigelowii communities, or high-level grasslands dominated by Nardus stricta or Juncus squarrosus, sometimes occurring in mosaics with floristically-related snow-bed vegetation. Where there is strong flushing, the community is often Floristic table M7found around the Philonoto-Saxifragetum spring and rill community. Most of the occurrences of the Car ex-Sphagnum russowii mire are close to or above the potential forest limit in the Scottish Highlands and the community is probably an essentially stable component of the vege tation pattern under present-day conditions; and it would probably remain so were grazing to be much reduced.
