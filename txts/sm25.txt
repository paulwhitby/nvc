"sm25","Zonation and succession The association marks a particular type of transition from the upper marsh to other maritime communities and the driftline stands are probably stable in time. The low-level stands of the Halimione sub-community overlap the habitat of the Frankenia laevis sub-commu-nity of the Suaeda vera-Limonium binervosum salt-marsh and at some sites in north Norfolk there is a mosaic of the two communities. The balance between them could be controlled by rabbit-grazing. Chapman (19606) suggested that Limonium bellidifolium declined on Hut Marsh, Scolt Head Island, Norfolk because of the increased vigour of H portulacoides following the reduction there of rabbit-grazing.
