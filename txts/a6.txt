"a6","Zonation and succession The community has been noted, either alone or with other aquatic vegetation, in distinctive zonations of brackish open-water transitions. It can show a rather sporadic pattern of occurrence from season to season and is eventually succeeded, where pools and dykes are not regularly cleaned, by swamp and fen. A quite common pattern seems to be for the Ceratophylletum to occur amongst the emergent shoots of the Scirpetum maritimi, one of the most frequent swamp communities of shallower brackish waters, or the Scir petum tabernaemontani, an under-recorded vegetation type but one also more tolerant of moderately saline conditions. From a marginal zone, the community can extend out beyond such swamps, comprising the only aquatic element of the zonation or occurring with other submerged assemblages tolerant of brackish conditions, notably certain kinds of Myriophyllum spicatum- Potamogeton pectinatus vegetation, where the only difference is sometimes the absence of C. submersum. Where the waters become less saline, both these communities can maintain an abundant presence, but the surface often becomes covered with a floating mat of the Lemnetum minoris, and the marginal swamps can then include the Phragmitetum or patches of Glycerio- Sparganion vegetation or Agrostis-Alopecurus wet grassland, decumbent shoots of which can trail out into open water. Patterns of these kinds can be clearly seen https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.010 Published online by Cambridge University Press44 among the various ditch types characterised from the North Kent Marshes (Charman 1981).
