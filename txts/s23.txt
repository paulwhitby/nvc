"s23","Zonation and succession In shallow, standing or sluggish waters, the vegetation often occurs as a fringe to the Glycerietum maximae, the Typhetum latifoliae and the Sparganietum erecti and in more intact sequences, some of its species may run under more open stands of these emergents to constitute a sparse understorey of the assemblage G type. Often, however, zonations are very much compressed and, along many dykes and canals, clumps of this vegetation alternate with stands of emergents. These more patchy and fragmentary mixtures also occur with swamps like the Caricetum acutiformis, the A core turn calami and the Sagittaria sagittifolia and Carex pseudocyperus communities. In running waters with a moderate flow, the most frequent neighbouring swamp is the Sparganietum erecti but, in more swiftly moving waters, even this may disappear, leaving a broken fringe of this Glycerio- Sparganion vegetation, perhaps backed by clumps of the Phalaridetum. Such patterns are also characteristic of the margins of some more permanent river shoals. Another very common pattern, around the edges of ponds and along stream margins where stock water, is for this vegetation to occur with the Glycerietum fluitan tis in transitions to damp mesotrophic pastures such as the Holco-Juncetum or certain kinds of Lolio-Cynosure- tum. Slumped fragments of these communities often occur intermixed with Glycerio-Sparganion vegetation in a confusing jumble along stream beds. Periodic disturbance often sets back any serai pro gression in the habitats in which this vegetation typically occurs but, in more stable situations, it seems to give way to swamps like the Glycerietum maximae, the Typhetum latifoliae and the Sparganietum erecti. Its most frequent species are light-demanding (Haslam 1978) and, though they may persist for some time as a swamp understorey, they disappear as the emergents advance and become more dense.
