"ov28","Zonation and succession Around wet areas in pastures, on flood-plains and away from river banks, the Agrostio-Ranunculetum can give way to the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla grassland or some kind of Lolium ley, with the Poa-Plantago community sometimes figuring as an intermediate or, where drier ground is trampled, the Polygonum-Chamomilla assem-blage. In sluggish streams or watering places, the Agrostis-Alopecurus community can figure. In wet arable fields, the Agrostio-Ranunculetum can pass to the Poa-Plantago or Matricaria-Stellaria community. On river shoals and silty margins of water-courses, the community can be found in mosaics and zonations with the Ranunculo-Alopecuretum, the Polygono-Bidentetum, the Polygonum-Poa community and the Rorippa-Filaginella community, sometimes also with patches of Phalaridetum. Repeated inundation sets back any tendency to suc-cession on river shoals, streamsides and pasture hollows and, on drier ground, grazing can play a part in checking https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.097 Published online by Cambridge University Press426 Vegetation of open habitats any serai change. Where areas are drained and grazed, a likely sequence is for the Poa-Plantago sub-community to develop into some kind of Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla sward or with reseeding, which has been a common fate, for it to be replaced by a Lolium ley.
