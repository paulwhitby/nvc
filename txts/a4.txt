"a4","Zonation and succession The Hydrocharis-Stratiotes community persists as a local aquatic element in the fragmentary and abbreviated open-water transitions of dykes and pools, pass ing landwards to swamp and fen, and being replaced by other aquatic vegetation with shifts in the trophic state and base richness of the waters. In the kind of extended open-water transitions des cribed by Pallis (1911) and Lambert & Jennings (1951), Stratiotes is shown growing beyond or persisting among emergent Scirpetum lacustris, Typhetum angustifoliae and Typhetum latifoliae swamps, and in the pools and dykes where it survives today, very narrow strips or clumps of such communities can be interposed between it and the banks, together with patches of other swamps like the Phragmitetum. Or, the open waters may give way sharply to fen vegetation, usually in Broadland of the Peucedano-Phragmitetum, the more species-poor Phragmites-Eupatorium fen or the eutrophic Phrag- mites-Urtica fen. Where the waters became more enriched in nitratenitrogen, calcium and magnesium, Wheeler & Giller (1982/?) showed that the dykes of the Catfield-Irstead fens supported a fairly rich kind of Elodea canadensis vegetation, from which Stratiotes, Utricularia vulgaris and Myriophyllum verticillatum were absent, but where floristic continuity was maintained through the floating element of the flora. Towards the other extreme, where the waters were impoverished, this element also per sisted, though in a rather attenuated form, together with M. verticillatum, Potamogeton obtusifolius and Nuphar lutea, with Utricularia vulgaris usually the most abundant plant. In this scheme, such assemblages are best retained here as fragmentary stands. In spatial terms, this environmental and floristic gradient was disposed through the dyke system, running from the fen margin to its centre. Distribution "
