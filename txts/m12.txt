"m12","Zonation and succession The Caricetum saxatilis typically occurs as small stands bordering rills or more strongly-irrrigated soligenous mires. It is possible that grazing prevents colonisation by Arctic-Alpine willows, though in the extreme environment characteristic here, the community is probably a climatic climax. Towards the lower end of its altitudinal range, the Caricetum saxatilis overlaps considerably with the Car ici-Saxifragetum and it can often be found as a fringing zone to this mire, giving way around to the Festuca- Alchemilla-Silene dwarf-herb community or, at its low est stations, to the Festuca-Agrostis-Alchemilla or Fes tuca-Agrostis-Thymus grasslands. Dryas-Silene vege tation can also figure among these zonations on rocky banks and, on dripping crags close to the source of irrigation, the Saxifraga-Alchemilla community. Such sequences are very characteristic of the Breadalbane area and more isolated localities in the north-west Highlands. At the very highest altitudes, the Carici-Saxifragetum may be absent from the flushes, when the Caricetum saxatilis gives way directly to the spring or rill vege tation, usually some kind of Cratoneuron-Festuca or Cratoneuron-Carex nigra flush. It can also occur in close association with some of the more calcicolous snow-bed communities. As with the other kinds of calcicolous flushes, the https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.016 Published online by Cambridge University Press126 Mires Caricetum saxatilis can sometimes be found within a markedly less calcicolous context, marking out very local areas of base-enrichment. Then, it can occur with the Carex-Sphagnum russowii mire, in water-tracks more remote from the source of flushing, and give way laterally to montane Nardo-Galion grasslands with Nardus stricta, Juncus squarrosus and Deschampsia cespitosa.
