"mg8","Zonation and succession Enclosed stands of the community in riverside pastures may be subject to uniform treatment and show no zonations to other vegetation types. In some cases, however, improvement and management have been restricted by difficult topography and an inability to prevent flooding. Here, and around the more fragmentary spring and flush stands, there may be zonations related to soil moisture conditions. A usual pattern is for the Cynosurus-Caltha community to give way to inundation communities on the bare substrates of river banks or pool-sides or to small-sedge mires of the Caricion davallianae in base-rich flushes. On drier ground, there may be a transition to the Lolium-Alope- curus-Festuca flood-pasture or, where there has been extensive improvement, directly to Lolio-Cynosuretum. Such a sequence can be seen on the drained levels of West Sedgemoor in Somerset. Artificial drainage can mediate a successional sequence from the Cynosurus-Caltha community to drier pasture types but neglect permits a fairly rapid invasion of Salix spp. and other shrubs and trees of wet woodland.
