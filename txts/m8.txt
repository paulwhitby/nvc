"m8","Zonation and succession The Carex-Sphagnum warnstorfii mire typically occurs as small stands which can be sharply marked off from unirrigated surrounds or which can form part of swamp and mire complexes where water-depth and degree of base-richness influence the vegetation patterns. In the former situation, the community can occupy stagnant hollows in tracts of montane grasslands with a fringe of irrigated sward between, or mark out areas of baseenrichment below high-altitude ombrogenous bog, usually the Calluna-Eriophorum mire. In more extensive soligenous areas, it can be seen in zonations analogous to those in which the Carex-Sphagnum squarrosum mire occurs at lower altitudes, with the Caricetum rostratae replacing it towards open water and patches of the Carex curta-Sphagnum russowii and Car ex-Calliergon mires indicating areas with a waning or increasing influence of base-richness. The frequent presence of seedlings of Salix aurita in stands of the community may indicate a tendency to wards the development of montane willow scrub but such successions have never been seen to progress further.
