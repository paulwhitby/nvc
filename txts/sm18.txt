"sm18","Zonation and succession At a few sites, there is a zonation within single extensive stands of the association from the Plantago sub-commu-nity through the Oenanthe sub-community to the Festuca sub-community. More generally, isolated stands of each of the sub-communities occur within other com-munities, the Oenanthe and Plantago sub-communities usually within the Juncetum gerardi, though the Plan-tago sub-community may also extend down-marsh into the upper part of the Puccinellietum maritimae. Unlike these two sub-communities where stands are sharply defined the Festuca sub-community often has rather diffuse boundaries with its neighbouring communities on the upper marsh. Juncus maritimus can be an aggressive invader. Packham & Liddle (1970) reported the transformation of an area of Puccinellietum maritimae within the space of 20 years. It has been conventional in British accounts to regard Juncus maritimus salt-marsh, if not as the true climax of succession, then at least as a very stable stage in upper marsh development which can be consideredfor most purposes as the climax. The association isclearly important on those marshes where it occurs but it is probably better to see it as part of a serai sequence par-allel to that involving the Juncetum gerardi. Distribution "
