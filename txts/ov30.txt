"ov30","Zonation and succession The Polygono-Bidentetum is typically a patchy element of zonations around fluctuating open waters where shifts in composition and structure of the vegetation are related to duration and depth of inundation. Quite commonly, this community gives way, on silts and clays subject to longer inundation, to the Rorippa-Filaginella community where Bidens remains quite common but where dominance usually passes to various annual knotweeds with Rorippa palustris and Filaginella uliginosa becoming more frequent. Upslope, at and beyond the limits of inundation, the community can give way to a zone of the Phalaridetum arundinaceae. Alter-natively, around ponds in pastures, there can be a transi-tion through the Agrostis-Alopecurus community or Ranunculetum scelerati to drier leys or pastures of the Lolio-Plantaginion, Cynosurion or Elymo-Rumicion types.
