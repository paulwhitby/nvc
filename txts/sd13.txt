"sd13","Zonation and succession The Sagina-Bryum community is a very local vegetation type representing early or repeatedly-renewed stages in the colonisation of young, only briefly-wetted slacks among stabilised dune ridges. It can be found in systems with more mature and drier slacks and with more summer-damp slacks according to the pattern of ground-water fluctuation and gives way on drier dune ridges to a range of fixed grasslands. A combination of drying and freedom from grazing can facilitate eventual development of wet scrubby woodland. Damper slacks on similar base-rich dunes to those with the Sagina-Bryum community can have stands of the Salix-Campy Hum community or, where older slacks are kept very wet and have a more vigorous shading canopy of Salix repens, stretches of Salix-Colliergon vegetation. Generally speaking, such slacks are separ-ated by ridges carrying Festuca-Galium grassland or where there is still some measure of sand movement, the more stable types of Ammophila-Festuca grassland. To these, the Sagina-Bryum vegetation can grade through the Holcus-Festuca sub-community, the grass cover thickening up, Ammophila becoming somewhat more vigorous and ephemerals and less competitive bryo-phytes being crowded out. Drier slack vegetation of the Salix-Holcus type may occur as a transitional zone in such sequences. As slacks with the Sagina-Bryum community age and dry, a process assisted by trapping of sand among the Salix repens, this vegetation is probably succeeded by the Salix-Holcus community which in turn may be invaded by shrubs and trees, as in its Ononis sub-community. Hippophae rhamnoides always has the potential to super-vene in such serai progressions. Distribution "
