"sm24","Zonation and succession The association often terminates the zonation at the upper limit of British salt-marshes. A common pattern, seen on many Essex salt-marshes and around the Exe in Devon (Proctor 1980), runs from Spartinetum townsendii or Asteretum tripolii through Halimione turn portulacoidis to the Atriplici-Elymetum. The largest stands of the asso-ciation appear to have developed from the Halimione turn. On creek levees, the association may develop from the Artemisietum maritimae or, more locally, the Spartine-tum townsendii. On high-level drift, there is sometimes a succession from the Atriplex strand-lines to the associa-tion. In sites inundated by only very exceptional storms, the association may be invaded by shrubs and trees but succession to woodland is likely to be prevented by the occasional subjection to saline waters.
