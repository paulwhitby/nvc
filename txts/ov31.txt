"ov31","Zonation and succession The Rorippa-Filaginella community can be found in mosaics and zonations with other kinds of inundation communities, wet grasslands and water-margin vegeta-tion according to differences in the extent of inundation, instability of the habitat and amount of nutrients in thewaters and substrates. On ground that emerges later from inundation and is not so unstable, the community can be replaced by amphibious perennial vegetation like the Polygonum amphibium community or by a zone of bare wet muds too shortly exposed for colonisation. Above, the com-munity can pass to the Bidens-Phalaris assemblage or to https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.100 Published online by Cambridge University PressOV31 Rorippa palustris-Filaginella uliginosa community 433 the Polygonum-Poa community on ground which remains exposed each summer for longer. Where thecommunity marks out periodically-flooded ruts in pasture or heath, it can give way more sharply to Elymo-Rumicion, Lolio-Plantaginion or Cynosurion swards, or to ericoid vegetation. With an increase in nitrogen enrichment on wetter ground, the Rorippa-Filaginella community is replaced by the Ranunculetum scelerati. Distribution "
