"s10","Zonation and succession In open-water transitions of larger lakes, especially where nutrient-poor waters occur over organic sub strates, the community occurs in similar zonations to those involving the Caricetum rostratae and it com monly grades laterally to that community with a switch in dominance to C. rostrata. On more inorganic material in such situations, it may also occur alongside the E. fluviatile sub-community of the Eleocharitetum palustris (e.g. Spence 1964). Around the margins of reservoirs and lowland pools with inorganic substrates, the Equisetum sub-community often forms a zone, sometimes with the Eleocharis sub-community of the Eleocharitetum, between open water and Elymo-Rumicion inundation communities or, where stock water, poached Cynosurion swards (Figure 13). https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.040 Published online by Cambridge University PressS10 Equisetetum fluviatile swamp 173 Distribution "
