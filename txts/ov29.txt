"ov29","Zonation and succession On expanses of sediment laid totally bare by flooding and then exposed on river islands and margins, the Ranunculo-Alopecuretum can develop patchily, either alone or with other inundation communities, their dis-position related in part to the texture and wetness of the sediments, though often with an element of chance about which assemblages colonise where (Figure 26). Such patterns also vary considerably from year to year according to the extent and character of the material once more flooded and exposed: Tuxen (in Ellenberg 1988) very aptly compared this variation to the squeez-ing and release of an accordion. Very often, the Agrostio-Ranunculetum is also involved in such patterns and each of the communities can pass to the Polygono-Bidentetum or Polygonum-Poa community with an increase in abundance of Bidens and Polygonum spp. These latter two assemblages are perhaps more common where silts prevail among the sediments. On muds which remain wetter longer, the Rorippa-Filago community can figure and, where the water table stays close to the surface all summer, the Polygonum amphi-bium community. Patchily on river islands, sometimes more extensively along banks and towards the limit of fluctuation around reservoirs, the Phalaridetum arundin-aceae may occur with the Ranunculo-Alopecuretum. Another very common situation for this community is in low-lying stretches of flood-plain pastures which are inundated in winter. Then, the Ranunculo-Alopecuretum usually gives way on less flooded ground where there has not been too much agricultural improvement to the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla grassland.
