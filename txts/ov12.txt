"ov12","Zonation and succession Typically, the Poa-Myosotis community occurs as patches with Lolio-Plantaginion swards, often with the Polygonum-Chamomilla assemblage in moderately tram-pled places, the Agrostis-Ranunculus community where less disturbed swards are kept moist or the Polygonum-Poa community where water stands long in winter. Patches of Urtica-Cirsium vegetation may also figure. Where the community occurs along paths, it can pass via patchy zones of the Polygonum-Chamomilla vegeta-tion to the Lolium-Dactylis grassland or mown recrea-tional swards of the Lolio-Plantaginion. Renewed care of damaged leys or reseeding of bare and poached areas can lead to replacement of the com-munity with Lolio-Plantaginion swards but continuing neglect can lead to a run-down of this vegetation into ranker weedy assemblages.
