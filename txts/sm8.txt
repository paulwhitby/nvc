"sm8","Zonation and succession Salicornia stands may form a distinct zone in the lower marsh, sometimes hundreds of metres deep. At some sites, particularly those on sandy substrates, patches of Salicornia may be separated from the main marsh front by several hundred metres of bare flat. The community can also occur in a mosaic with the Puccinellietum marit-imae or with the Spartinetum townsendii. The expansion of the latter has much reduced the area of lower marsh available for pioneer Salicornia establishment especiallyin south-east England. Although the annual Salicornietum is generally thelowest marsh community proper it may rarely initiate a succession because summer accretion can be offset by ablation after the stands have disappeared in the winter. Chapman (1957) has, however, produced a cartographic record of changes in the distribution of Salicornia marsh at Scolt Head, Norfolk with ageing of open and closed marshes. Distribution "
