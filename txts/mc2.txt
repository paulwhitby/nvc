"mc2","Zonation and succession Towards high-water mark, the community grades into the Ramalinetum scopularis lichen zone which, in shel-tered sites in western Scotland, may have some of the larger foliose lichens characteristic of Lobarion commu-nities (James et al. 1977). Above, there is often a transi-tion to the Festuca-Armeria maritime grassland, sometimes abrupt, in other cases more gradual through the Ligusticum variant of the typical sub-community of the grassland. On some very tall cliffs, where there are more sheltered ledges above, there may be a switch from the Armeria-Ligusticum community to the Rhodiola-Armeria community before an intact grassland develops. Where waterlogged saline soils occur on ledges or abut onto low cliff-tops, the community is replaced by perched salt-marsh vegetation of the Leontodon sub-community of the Juncetum gerardi.
