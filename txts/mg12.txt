"mg12","Zonation and succession The Lolium-Holcus sub-community generally shows abrupt zonations to other vegetation types, sharpened by treatment where stands abut on to agricultural land or by sudden topographic differences where stands lie on steep banks alongside ditches. Occasionally, there are more gradual zonations to the Festuca-Agrostis-Potentilla community with increased grazing pressure or, on the upper salt-marsh, to the Oenanthe sub-community on more saline soils. Although this latter sub-community sometimes occurs as extensive pure stands, it is frequently encountered in a mosaic with some form of Juncus maritimus salt-marsh which replaces it on more frequently submerged ground.Distribution "
