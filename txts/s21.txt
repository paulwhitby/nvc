"s21","Zonation and succession The Scirpetum maritimi can occur at various levels on coastal salt-marshes and, exceptionally, there may be a zonation within stands between the various sub-communities, from the Scirpus-dominated type at the lowest level, through the Atriplex and Agrostis sub-communities, to the Potentilla sub-community. More often, stands of one or other of the sub-communities, sometimes quite small in extent, occur within other salt marsh communities, forming mosaics with the Puccinel- lietum maritimae or, more usually, the Juncetum gerardi, the Juncetum maritimi (Packham & Liddle 1970) or the Festuca rubra-Agrostis stolonifera-Potentilla anserina mesotrophic grassland. The boundaries of the Scirpetum maritimi are generally sharply marked by the dominance of S. maritimus but the vegetation types may grade one into another through the associates in the subsidiary layer of the swamp.In estuaries, the Scirpetum maritimi is sometimes the pioneer vegetation in an inverted zonation, as on the Exe for example, where it occurs down-slope from the Spartinetum townsendii and the Juncetum gerardi (Proctor 1980). The community also grades to other swamp types in salt-marsh depressions or on estuarine foreshores. It frequently passes gradually into the Scirpetum tabernaemontani with a switch in dominance between the two Scirpus taxa and mosaics with the Phragmitetum australis are common. On the Nith in the Solway Firth and at Dingwall in the Cromarty Firth, the Scirpetum maritimi occurs seaward of the Atriplex sub-community of this swamp type. In a number of sheltered sea-lochs in western Scot land, the community occurs as a fringe of emergent vegetation giving way sharply above to Alnus woodland, a zonation which is widespread in the Baltic (Tyler 1969/?).
