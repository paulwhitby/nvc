"mc10","Zonation and succession This maritime grassland generally occurs as a zone on grazed sea-cliffs above the Festuca-Armeria community (into which it may grade through the Armeria sub-com-munity) and at roughly the same level as the Festuca-Holcus community. As such, it forms part of the sequence of cliff grasslands developed in relation to decreasing maritime influence on moving inland. Above it usually passes to maritime forms of heath or acid grassland. It may also form zonations with the Festuca-Armeria and Festuca-Holcus grasslands in response to variations in grazing pressure and with increased inaccessibility to stock it can grade to these communities through theirsub-association of Plantago spp. (Figure 23). The zonation of the various sub-communities reflects the influence of both salt-spray deposition and soil pat-terns. The Armeria sub-community usually forms a zone seaward of the C. panicea sub-community and the Schoenus sub-community occurs patchily within the latter where there is pronounced flushing. Grazing probably mediates a successional relation-ship between the Festuca-Plantago community and both the Festuca-Armeria and Festuca-Holcus communities, particularly the latter. It is possible that the C. panicea sub-community develops from wet maritime heath where this is heavily grazed. Distribution "
