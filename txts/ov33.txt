"ov33","Zonation and succession Typically, the Polygonum-Poa community occurs on the wettest ground among patchworks of other kinds of weed vegetation, leys and pasture swards on farmland, recreation areas and along tracks. Usually, it is the degree of wetness, disturbance and trampling which influences the character and disposi-tion of these assemblages. Where the ground is some-what drier but still trampled, the Polygonum-Poa community often gives way to some kind of Polygonion avicularis vegetation like the Polygonum-Chamomilla and Poa-Plantago major communities where P. aviculare and Poa annua remain constant but where the otherannual knotweeds fade in importance. This can then pass to Lolio-Plantaginion swards where more trample-resistant plants remain common within a more extensive grassy matrix. Similar sequences to this develop where ill-sown leys are subject to much poaching in wet spring weather. If irregular disturbance of damp, eutrophic soils remains a feature, as where farm vehicles churn up the ground, Polygono-Chenopodion communities canreplace the Polygonum-Poa vegetation as with the Poa-Senecio or Poa-Myosotis communities. Where disturbance or trampling of such habitats ceases, the Polygonum-Poa community is usuallyreplaced by less ephemeral Polygono-Chenopodion weed vegetation, then by eutrophic tall-herb stands of the Artemisietea, usually dominated by Urtica dioica and large Cirsium spp. Disturbance This community is very common in suitable habitats throughout the lowlands. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.102 Published online by Cambridge University PressOV33 Polygonum lapathifolium-Poa annua community 437 Affinities The Polygonum-Poa community contains those stands of ephemeral vegetation in which various species of Polygonum are prominent in the absence of Bidens tri-partita. The high frequency and abundance of plants like Stellaria media, Chenopodium album and Chamomillasuaveolens put this assemblage close the Polygono-Chenopodion alliance but it clearly belongs among the Bidention communities. In some existing treatments, vegetation of this type is subsumed with the Polygono-Bidentetum.
