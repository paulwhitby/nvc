"cg11","Zonation and succession Most often, zonations between the Festuca-Agrostis- Alchemilla grass-heath and other vegetation types reflect edaphic or altitudinal/climatic gradients or differences in grazing intensity. At some sites, the community gives way, over frag mentary lithomorphic soils developed over the same substrate, to more open vegetation, as on Skye, where it passes to scree communities on Tertiary basalt talus or pavement vegetation on Durness Limestone (Birks 1973). More usually, however, it occurs, often with the Festuca-Agrostis-Thymus grassland, within patch works of other communities whose distribution reflects the occurrence of different bedrock types and the extent of overlying drift. Where calcareous deposits are well represented, stands can be more extensive, as on Ben Lawers, in Caenlochan and Beinn a’Ghlo (Ratcliffe 1977, Huntley 1979); elsewhere, typical but smaller https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.030 Published online by Cambridge University PressCG11 Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Alchemilla alpina grass-heath 249 stands occur as islands within predominantly calcifuge grasslands and heaths over acid rocks or deep drift, as on the gneisses of the north-western Highlands (Ratcliffe 1977). Where suitable rocks extend over a considerable range of altitude, as on the Dalradian schists, the community may be part of altitudinal sequences which reflect the increasing cold and rainfall at higher alti tudes. Then, it may give way below to the Festuca- Agrostis-Thymus grassland and above to the Festuca- Alchemilla-Silene dwarf-herb community. The occurrence of crags within stands of the Festuca- Agrostis-Alchemilla grass-heath is a common feature and, at higher altitudes, the community forms mosaics here with the Dryas-Silene vegetation which reflect the lack of grazing on the more inaccessible ledges. Good examples of this kind of pattern have been described from Beinn a’Ghlo on Dalradian limestone and from Lewisian gneiss in Ross and Sutherland (Ratcliffe 1977) and the occasional prominence of taller herbs is encountered wherever grazing is restricted.
