"mg13","Zonation and succession Small stands commonly form part of the often fragmentary sequences of communities which develop around fluctuating open waters in relation to frequency of inundation and the amount of disturbance by sediment movement and trampling. A frequent pattern is for an intact pasture sward (such as the typical variant of the typical sub-community of the Lolio-Cynosuretum) to give way through an intermediate (the A. geniculatus variant of the same vegetation) to the Agrostis-Alopecurus community on puddled soil around a pool or stream that is used by stock for watering. On moister silts which are more frequently inundated, this in turn may pass to more ephemeral inundation vegetation or to the Glycerietum fluitantis or related assemblages in the Glycerio-Sparganion. In washlands, the community occurs in mosaics with the Glycerietum fluitantis, the Festuca rubra-Agrostis stolonifera-Potentilla anserina inundation grassland and, around dykes, the Phalaridetum arundinaceae and Glycerietum maximae. Where the community occurs around areas of freshwater seepage on the upper salt-marsh, it may pass to more halophytic vegetation types in which A. stolonifera remains prominent. https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.017 Published online by Cambridge University Press104 Mesotrophic grasslands Distribution "
