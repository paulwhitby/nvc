"h9","Zonation and succession The Calluna-Deschampsia heath can be found in zonations and mosaics with wet-heath and mire vegetation where the major influence on floristic variation is natural differences in the moisture content of suites of base-poor and oligotrophic soils. Even in such situations, however, the effects of such factors as burning, grazing and draining complicate the patterns of vegetation types and, in many cases, these are of overriding importance, their effects being especially clearly seen over more uniform tracts of soils, where patchworks of the community, with grasslands and woodlands, represent stages in regeneration and succession. Neglect of tra ditional treatments has seen extensive invasion by trees at some sites, particularly in the lowlands, though it is there, too, that previously large tracts of heath and woodland have been most assiduously reclaimed for agriculture. In other cases, both in the lowlands and around the upland fringes, the community has been replaced by coniferous plantations. In a few sites, the Calluna-Deschampsia heath forms the dry-heath component in the classic kind of lowland valley-mire zonation that is so characteristic of central southern and south-west Britain, occurring over the most free-draining of the sequence of acidic soils dis posed around elongated hollows through which there is concentration of ground waters draining from the sur rounds or from particular springs and flushes. Even through the lowland parts of the range of the community, the climate is not sufficiently oceanic to see the transgression of Erica tetralix and Molinia on to more free-draining soils, so a humid heath zone, such as is typical of these patterns in the more Atlantic parts of the https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391658.053 Published online by Cambridge University PressH9 Calluna vulgaris-Deschampsia flexuosa heath 465 country, is lacking, and there is generally a sharper shift, over ground that shows increasingly strong gleying, to the Ericetum tetralicis wet heath, where these two species can have ascendancy over Calluna', and then, where there is continuous stagnation more or less to the surface, with accumulation of peat proper, the vegetation changes to the Narthecio-Sphagnetum bog. This kind of pattern can still be seen in parts of Cannock Chase, developed around the valleys incised into the Bunter sandstones, pebble-beds and breccias (Ratcliffe 1977), but, though the systems are hydrologically simi lar to those of, say, the New Forest, the flora is, throughout the sequence, of a more impoverished character. Both the Ericetum and Narthecio-Sphagnetum are approaching their geographical limits in this part of Britain and, over the drier ground, generations of burning and disturbance have much reduced the Sphagnum component of the wet heath and favoured a general abundance of heather throughout, thus blurring the boundaries between the communities. More recently, wholesale lowering of the water-table, probably as a result of coal-mining beneath the Chase, is drying out the mire systems there, eliminating the wetter elements or causing them to migrate downstream. Essentially the same pattern as this can be seen at somewhat higher altitudes in the North York Moors, where certain of the drainage hollows on the plateau, notably at Fen Bog, have zonations which, though also affected by burning and grazing, still show the controlling influence of a stagnation gradient. In this area, though, and around the upland fringes of the southern Pennines, the Calluna-Deschampsia heath is more often found in what is really a reverse sequence of communities, giving way over gentler slopes at higher altitudes to wet heath, then to blanket mire, with the development of increasingly thick ombrogenous peats. In the North York Moors, the Calluna-Deschampsia heath and the Juncus-Dicranum sub-community of the Ericetum tetralicis form the bulk of the vegetation cover over the complex patchworks of Anglezarke humo-ferric pod zols, Maw stagnopodzols and Wilcocks stagnohumic gleys, with relatively small areas of Calluna-Er iophorum mire marking out Winter Hill peats, almost the whole of these patterns being overlain by systems of swiddens burned for grouse-rearing. On the Pennines, the wet heath zone is much less extensive and the Calluna- Deschampsia heath frequently gives way directly, over what is often a much fretted fringe to the ombrogenous peat, to the blanket mire vegetation, characteristically in this part of Britain of the Eriophorum type, in which the effects of pollution, grazing, burning and draining are also all too evident. In such zonations, the increase in the abundance of Eriophorum vaginatum among the heather is often the only indicator of the switch in vegetation types, species such as Deschampsiaflexuosa, the acrocar pous mosses and encrusting lichens maintaining their frequency over the dry peat margins. Patches of the Calluna-Deschampsia heath can recur at higher levels where the peat blanket is interrupted by grit outcrops but, increasingly in the wetter cooler climate of these high edges, the community is replaced by the Vaccinium- Deschampsia heath in which bilberry is the typical dominant. Rather different kinds of vegetation patterns are to be seen where the Calluna-Deschampsia heath occurs on tracts of prevailingly dry, base-poor and oligotrophic soils, such as have developed on sandstone scarps and plateaus and over coarser superficials at lower altitudes through the range of the community. In such situations, it is patchworks of the heath with grasslands and woodlands that make up the bulk of the scenery, so characteristic of places like Delamere and Sherwood Forests and the higher ground in Cannock Chase. Such patterns are largely a reflection of treatment history, with burning and grazing, or their neglect, playing a major part in the disposition of stands of various of the sub-communities of the Calluna-Deschampsia heath, of Deschampsia flexuosa grassland, which is often a grazed derivative of the Galium sub-community within which heather has been substantially reduced, and of the Quercus-Betula-Deschampsia woodland, which is the characteristic climax forest of dry, acidic soils in this part of Britain, derived from the heath by invasion of oak and birch. Widespread abandonment of traditional treatments has often favoured the succession to woodland, with the virtual extinction of heath in some sites, though temporary patches of the Calluna-Deschampsia community comprise the typical gap flora of the Quer- cus-Betula-DeschampsiawGQ(\\an&. In many places, too, land-use changes have led to an extensive spread of the Pteridium-Galium community which can readily replace the Calluna-Deschampsia heath on the deeper of the soils that it favours. Commercial afforestation has also been extensive over many stretches of podzolised soils through the range of the Calluna-Deschampsia heath which, with some preparation, can support reasonable crops of Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra var. maritima and larches, all of which, especially the pines, are readily able to seed into remaining tracts of open heathland around. The brown sand soils of the Midland plain too, though droughty, highly impoverished and susceptible to erosion by wind and rain, are readily worked and many areas have been reclaimed and improved for arable and pastoral agriculture, fragmenting the remaining distribution of the community.
