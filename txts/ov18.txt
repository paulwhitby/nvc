"ov18","Zonation and succession The Polygonum-Chamomilla community occurs with other weed assemblages and grasslands around tracks and gateways in sequences of vegetation related to the intensity of disturbance and trampling. Often, the community occupies an intermediate posi-tion between the Poa-Plantago vegetation of the most heavily trampled situations and various pasture, ley or verge grasslands where treading is not so severe but where grazing or mowing maintain the sward. A widespread pattern is for this community to pass to the Lolio-Plan-taginetum on recreational swards and frequently cut verges, or to some Lolium ley or the Lolio-Cynosuretum in agricultural enclosures. On less frequently mown path edges, the Lolium-Dactylis grassland can figure or, on disturbed verge margins, the Poa-Taraxacum community. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511541834.087 Published online by Cambridge University PressOV18 Polygonum aviculare-Chamomilla suaveolens community 385 More disturbed tracksides and gateways can also have the Poa-Senecio or Stellaria-Capsella communities, where species such as Senecio vulgaris, Stellaria media, Sinapis arvensis and Chenopodium album join Poa annua, Chamomilla suaveolens, Polygonum aviculare and Cap-sella bursa-pastoris as prominent elements of the flora. Some of these transitions also represent successional developments from the Polygonum-Chamomilla commu-nity with a reduction in trampling pressure. Such shifts can continue through the more grassy Lolium-Dactylis community or, with disturbance, through the weed com-munities of the Polygono-Chenopodion and Fumario-Euphorbion. Where disturbance ceases, progression to sub-scrub vegetation of the Rubus-Holcus type and then to Prunetalia scrub, is usual. Distribution "
