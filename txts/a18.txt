"a18","Zonation and succession The Ranunculetum fluitantis can sometimes monopolise the vegetated stretches in faster, stony-bedded rivers but it is often found in mosaics with other aquatic communities where there is variation in turbulence and depth of the waters and the character of the substrate, and gives way to other assemblages with a shift in these factors downstream and up. https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.022 Published online by Cambridge University Press86 Aquatic communities Where the flow becomes a little slacker and the bed finer, this kind of vegetation can be found with stands of Elodea canadensis and, where the waters are less base poor, the Potamogeton-M . spicatum community, and these may replace the Ranunculetum fluitantis where lower river catchments are dominated by shales or clays. In highly eutrophic steams, Potamogeton pectinatus stands can take over from the community. Floatingleaved stands of Potamogeton natans or Polygonum amphibium may occur and in the shallows there can be a zone of Glycerio-Sparganion vegetation or patches of the Phalar ide turn. These often persist along the margins of moving waters upstream of the major Ranunculetum fluitantis stretches where the submerged vegetation tends to com prise mixtures of Callitriche stagnalis stands, sometimes with the Ranunculetum aquatilis or, in more base-poor streams, the Potamogeton-M. alterniflorum or M. alterniflorum communities.
