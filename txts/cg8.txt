"cg8","Zonation and succession Since most remaining tracts of the community occur within enclosures sandwiched between plateau and vale agricultural land, natural zonations to other vegetation types developed in relation to soil sequences over the scarp are rare. In a few places, however, the Carlina- Hypericum sub-community can be seen grading through the Avenula sub-community to rank, mesotrophic swards over slope-foot colluvium. https://doi.org/10.1017/9780521391665.027 Published online by Cambridge University Press214 Calcicolous grasslands More often, however, the community occurs in mosaics with open vegetation, rough grasslands and scrub which reflect serai progressions mediated by soil development and the amount of grazing. Colonisation of artificial habitats, such as quarry floors, ledges and spoil begins with the appearance of rank weeds such as Epilobium angustifolium, Hypericum spp. and Erigeron acer and, in damper places, patches of acrocarpous mosses (Shimwell 1968Â«, 1971/?) and proceeds to the more stable vegetation of the Hieracium sub-community. Where grazing is absent, this can probably be quickly invaded by shrubs and trees but, where stock or rabbits have access and there is deeper accumulation of soil, it is possible that it develops into the Carlina- Hypericum sub-community. With light grazing, the tus socky swards of the A venula sub-community may supervene and develop into patchy scrub with Avenulapubescens grassland or Arrhenatheretum between. The commonest scrub species in the area are Crataegus monogyna, Prunus spinosa, Ulex europaeus and Rosa spp. and the natural progression would be to the Geranium sub-community of the Fraxinus-Acer-Mercurialis woodland, stands of which occur in close association with Sesleria-Scabiosa grassland. In damper situations, Salix spp. may appear as early woody colonisers. Distribution "
