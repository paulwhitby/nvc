"s1","Zonation and succession In west Norfolk, the Caricetum elatae may occasionally fill more shallow hollows but it usually occurs as a zone around open water or gives way in deeper water to the https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107340817.031 Published online by Cambridge University PressSI Caricetum elatae sedge-swamp 129 Cladietum marisci (Haslam 1965, Wheeler 1975). Mosaics of the two dominants commonly occur at the junctions of the communities. Away from the water, the zonation varies with the basin slope: on more gradual surrounds, there is often a fairly sharp transition to some kind of rush-pasture and then to calcicolous grassland; around more steeply sided hollows, calcicolous grassland may abut directly on to the Caricetum elatae (Wheeler 1975). In its Cumbrian localities, the community occurs in close association with the Potentillo-Caricetum rostratae to which it grades in deeper water and elements of which may occur between the C. elata tussocks forming mosaics (Pearsall 1918, Holdgate 1955/?, Pigott & Wil son 1978). The advance of the Caricetum elatae and its gradual colonisation by Salix atrocinerea and Alnus glutinosa form part of the successional changes catalogued at Esthwaite North Fen over some 50 years (Pearsall 1918, Tansley 1939, Pigott & Wilson 1978). Here, an area of what seems to have been Phragmitetum australis reed swamp and Potentillo-Caricetum rostratae in 1914-16 was occupied by the Caricetum elatae by 1929 and by 1969 had an open woodland cover. C. elata appears to be tolerant of a certain amount of shade (Pigott & Wilson 1978), although beneath a Salix-Alnus canopy, its dominance weakens and the major tussock sedge in the open woodland at this site is C. paniculata.
